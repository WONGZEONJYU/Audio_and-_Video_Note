.SH SYNOPSIS

ffmpeg [\fIglobal_options\fR] {[\fIinput_file_options\fR] \-i \fIinput_url\fR} ... {[\fIoutput_file_options\fR] \fIoutput_url\fR} ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBffmpeg\fR is a universal media converter. It can read a wide variety of
inputs \- including live grabbing/recording devices \- filter, and transcode them
into a plethora of output formats.
.PP
\&\fBffmpeg\fR reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which can be regular
files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR option, and writes to an arbitrary number of output "files", which are
specified by a plain output url. Anything found on the command line which
cannot be interpreted as an option is considered to be an output url.
.PP
Each input or output url can, in principle, contain any number of streams of
different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). The allowed number and/or
types of streams may be limited by the container format. Selecting which
streams from which inputs will go into which output is either done automatically
or with the \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR option (see the Stream selection chapter).
.PP
To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices (0\-based). E.g.
the first input file is \f(CW0\fR, the second is \f(CW1\fR, etc. Similarly, streams
within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`2:3\*(C'\fR refers to the
fourth stream in the third input file. Also see the Stream specifiers chapter.
.PP
As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified
file. Therefore, order is important, and you can have the same
option on the command line multiple times. Each occurrence is
then applied to the next input or output file.
Exceptions from this rule are the global options (e.g. verbosity level),
which should be specified first.
.PP
Do not mix input and output files \-\- first specify all input files, then all
output files. Also do not mix options which belong to different files. All
options apply ONLY to the next input or output file and are reset between files.
.PP
Some simple examples follow.

.Ve
.PP
\&\fBffmpeg\fR calls the libavformat library (containing demuxers) to read
input files and get packets containing encoded data from them. When there are
multiple input files, \fBffmpeg\fR tries to keep them synchronized by
tracking lowest timestamp on any active input stream.
.PP
Encoded packets are then passed to the decoder (unless streamcopy is selected
for the stream, see further for a description). The decoder produces
uncompressed frames (raw video/PCM audio/...) which can be processed further by
filtering (see next section). After filtering, the frames are passed to the
encoder, which encodes them and outputs encoded packets. Finally those are
passed to the muxer, which writes the encoded packets to the output file.
.SS Filtering
.IX Subsection "Filtering"
Before encoding, \fBffmpeg\fR can process raw audio and video frames using
filters from the libavfilter library. Several chained filters form a filter
graph. \fBffmpeg\fR distinguishes between two types of filtergraphs:
simple and complex.
.PP
\fISimple filtergraphs\fR
.IX Subsection "Simple filtergraphs"
.PP
Simple filtergraphs are those that have exactly one input and output, both of
the same type. In the above diagram they can be represented by simply inserting
an additional step between decoding and encoding:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
Simple filtergraphs are configured with the per-stream \fB\-filter\fR option
(with \fB\-vf\fR and \fB\-af\fR aliases for video and audio respectively).
A simple filtergraph for video can look for example like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&         _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_        _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_        _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_        _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_

.Ve
.PP
Note that some filters change frame properties but not frame contents. E.g. the
\&\f(CW\*(C`fps\*(C'\fR filter in the example above changes number of frames, but does not
touch the frame contents. Another example is the \f(CW\*(C`setpts\*(C'\fR filter, which
only sets timestamps and otherwise passes the frames unchanged.
.PP
\fIComplex filtergraphs\fR
.IX Subsection "Complex filtergraphs"
.PP
Complex filtergraphs are those which cannot be described as simply a linear
processing chain applied to one stream. This is the case, for example, when the graph has
more than one input and/or output, or when output stream type is different from
input. They can be represented with the following diagram:
.PP
.Vb 10

.Ve
.PP
Complex filtergraphs are configured with the \fB\-filter_complex\fR option.
Note that this option is global, since a complex filtergraph, by its nature,
cannot be unambiguously associated with a single stream or file.
.PP
The \fB\-lavfi\fR option is equivalent to \fB\-filter_complex\fR.
.PP
A trivial example of a complex filtergraph is the \f(CW\*(C`overlay\*(C'\fR filter, which
has two video inputs and one video output, containing one video overlaid on top
of the other. Its audio counterpart is the \f(CW\*(C`amix\*(C'\fR filter.
.SS "Stream copy"
.IX Subsection "Stream copy"
Stream copy is a mode selected by supplying the \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR parameter to the
\&\fB\-codec\fR option. It makes \fBffmpeg\fR omit the decoding and encoding
step for the specified stream, so it does only demuxing and muxing. It is useful
for changing the container format or modifying container-level metadata. The
diagram above will, in this case, simplify to this:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&         _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_              _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_            _\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_
\&        |       |            |              |          |        |
\&        | input |  demuxer   | encoded data |  muxer   | output |
\&        | file  | \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-> | packets      | \-\-\-\-\-\-\-> | file   |
\&        |_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_|            |_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_|          |_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_\|_|
.Ve
.PP
Since there is no decoding or encoding, it is very fast and there is no quality
loss. However, it might not work in some cases because of many factors. Applying
filters is obviously also impossible, since filters work on uncompressed data.
.SH "STREAM SELECTION"
.IX Header "STREAM SELECTION"
\&\fBffmpeg\fR provides the \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR option for manual control of stream selection in each
output file. Users can skip \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR and let ffmpeg perform automatic stream selection as
described below. The \f(CW\*(C`\-vn / \-an / \-sn / \-dn\*(C'\fR options can be used to skip inclusion of
video, audio, subtitle and data streams respectively, whether manually mapped or automatically
selected, except for those streams which are outputs of complex filtergraphs.
.SS Description
.IX Subsection "Description"
The sub-sections that follow describe the various rules that are involved in stream selection.
The examples that follow next show how these rules are applied in practice.
.PP
While every effort is made to accurately reflect the behavior of the program, FFmpeg is under
continuous development and the code may have changed since the time of this writing.
.PP
\fIAutomatic stream selection\fR
.IX Subsection "Automatic stream selection"
.PP
In the absence of any map options for a particular output file, ffmpeg inspects the output
format to check which type of streams can be included in it, viz. video, audio and/or
subtitles. For each acceptable stream type, ffmpeg will pick one stream, when available,
from among all the inputs.
.PP
It will select that stream based upon the following criteria:
.IP \(bu 4
for video, it is the stream with the highest resolution,
.IP \(bu 4
for audio, it is the stream with the most channels,
.IP \(bu 4
for subtitles, it is the first subtitle stream found but there's a caveat.
The output format's default subtitle encoder can be either text-based or image-based,
and only a subtitle stream of the same type will be chosen.
.PP
In the case where several streams of the same type rate equally, the stream with the lowest
index is chosen.
.PP
Data or attachment streams are not automatically selected and can only be included
using \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIManual stream selection\fR
.IX Subsection "Manual stream selection"
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR is used, only user-mapped streams are included in that output file,
with one possible exception for filtergraph outputs described below.
.PP
\fIComplex filtergraphs\fR
.IX Subsection "Complex filtergraphs"
.PP
If there are any complex filtergraph output streams with unlabeled pads, they will be added
to the first output file. This will lead to a fatal error if the stream type is not supported
by the output format. In the absence of the map option, the inclusion of these streams leads
to the automatic stream selection of their types being skipped. If map options are present,
these filtergraph streams are included in addition to the mapped streams.
.PP
Complex filtergraph output streams with labeled pads must be mapped once and exactly once.
.PP
\fIStream handling\fR
.IX Subsection "Stream handling"
.PP
Stream handling is independent of stream selection, with an exception for subtitles described
below. Stream handling is set via the \f(CW\*(C`\-codec\*(C'\fR option addressed to streams within a
specific \fIoutput\fR file. In particular, codec options are applied by ffmpeg after the
stream selection process and thus do not influence the latter. If no \f(CW\*(C`\-codec\*(C'\fR option is
specified for a stream type, ffmpeg will select the default encoder registered by the output
file muxer.
.PP
An exception exists for subtitles. If a subtitle encoder is specified for an output file, the
first subtitle stream found of any type, text or image, will be included. ffmpeg does not validate
if the specified encoder can convert the selected stream or if the converted stream is acceptable
within the output format. This applies generally as well: when the user sets an encoder manually,
the stream selection process cannot check if the encoded stream can be muxed into the output file.
If it cannot, ffmpeg will abort and \fIall\fR output files will fail to be processed.
.SS Examples
.IX Subsection "Examples"
The following examples illustrate the behavior, quirks and limitations of ffmpeg's stream
selection methods.

They assume the following three input files.

.Ve
.PP
There are three output files specified, and for the first two, no \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR options
are set, so ffmpeg will select streams for these two files automatically.
.PP
\&\fIout1.mkv\fR is a Matroska container file and accepts video, audio and subtitle streams,
so ffmpeg will try to select one of each type.For video, it will select \f(CW\*(C`stream 0\*(C'\fR from \fIB.mp4\fR, which has the highest
resolution among all the input video streams.For audio, it will select \f(CW\*(C`stream 3\*(C'\fR from \fIB.mp4\fR, since it has the greatest
number of channels.For subtitles, it will select \f(CW\*(C`stream 2\*(C'\fR from \fIB.mp4\fR, which is the first subtitle
stream from among \fIA.avi\fR and \fIB.mp4\fR.
.PP
\&\fIout2.wav\fR accepts only audio streams, so only \f(CW\*(C`stream 3\*(C'\fR from \fIB.mp4\fR is
selected.
.PP
For \fIout3.mov\fR, since a \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR option is set, no automatic stream selection will
occur. The \f(CW\*(C`\-map 1:a\*(C'\fR option will select all audio streams from the second input
\&\fIB.mp4\fR. No other streams will be included in this output file.
.PP
For the first two outputs, all included streams will be transcoded. The encoders chosen will
be the default ones registered by each output format, which may not match the codec of the
selected input streams.
.PP
For the third output, codec option for audio streams has been set
to \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR, so no decoding-filtering-encoding operations will occur, or \fIcan\fR occur.
Packets of selected streams shall be conveyed from the input file and muxed within the output
file.

Although \fIout1.mkv\fR is a Matroska container file which accepts subtitle streams, only a
video and audio stream shall be selected. The subtitle stream of \fIC.mkv\fR is image-based
and the default subtitle encoder of the Matroska muxer is text-based, so a transcode operation
for the subtitles is expected to fail and hence the stream isn't selected. However, in
\&\fIout2.mkv\fR, a subtitle encoder is specified in the command and so, the subtitle stream is
selected, in addition to the video stream. The presence of \f(CW\*(C`\-an\*(C'\fR disables audio stream
selection for \fIout2.mkv\fR.

.PP
A filtergraph is setup here using the \f(CW\*(C`\-filter_complex\*(C'\fR option and consists of a single
video filter. The \f(CW\*(C`overlay\*(C'\fR filter requires exactly two video inputs, but none are
specified, so the first two available video streams are used, those of \fIA.avi\fR and
\&\fIC.mkv\fR. The output pad of the filter has no label and so is sent to the first output file
\&\fIout1.mp4\fR. Due to this, automatic selection of the video stream is skipped, which would
have selected the stream in \fIB.mp4\fR. The audio stream with most channels viz. \f(CW\*(C`stream 3\*(C'\fR
in \fIB.mp4\fR, is chosen automatically. No subtitle stream is chosen however, since the MP4
format has no default subtitle encoder registered, and the user hasn't specified a subtitle encoder.
.PP
The 2nd output file, \fIout2.srt\fR, only accepts text-based subtitle streams. So, even though
the first subtitle stream available belongs to \fIC.mkv\fR, it is image-based and hence skipped.
The selected stream, \f(CW\*(C`stream 2\*(C'\fR in \fIB.mp4\fR, is the first text-based subtitle stream.

.PP
The overlay filter, requiring two video inputs, uses the first two unused video streams. Those
are the streams from \fIA.avi\fR and \fIC.mkv\fR. The overlay output isn't labelled, so it is

The aresample filter is sent the first unused audio stream, that of \fIA.avi\fR. Since this filter
output is also unlabelled, it too is mapped to the first output file. The presence of \f(CW\*(C`\-an\*(C'\fR
only suppresses automatic or manual stream selection of audio streams, not outputs sent from
filtergraphs. Both these mapped streams shall be ordered before the mapped stream in \fIout1.mp4\fR.

The video, audio and subtitle streams mapped to \f(CW\*(C`out2.mkv\*(C'\fR are entirely determined by

.SH OPTIONS
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.
.PP
If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
\&'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.
.PP
Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with "no". For example using "\-nofoo"
will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.
.SS "Stream specifiers"
.IX Subsection "Stream specifiers"
Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.
.PP
A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-codec:a:1 ac3\*(C'\fR contains the
\&\f(CW\*(C`a:1\*(C'\fR stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.
.PP
A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in \f(CW\*(C`\-b:a 128k\*(C'\fR matches all audio
streams.
.PP
An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, \f(CW\*(C`\-codec copy\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`\-codec: copy\*(C'\fR would copy all the streams without reencoding.
.PP
Possible forms of stream specifiers are:
.IP \fIstream_index\fR 4
.IX Item "stream_index"
Matches the stream with this index. E.g. \f(CW\*(C`\-threads:1 4\*(C'\fR would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4. If \fIstream_index\fR is used as an
additional stream specifier (see below), then it selects stream number
\&\fIstream_index\fR from the matching streams. Stream numbering is based on the
order of the streams as detected by libavformat except when a program ID is
also specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of the streams in the
program.
.IP \fIstream_type\fR\fB[:\fR\fIadditional_stream_specifier\fR\fB]\fR 4
.IX Item "stream_type[:additional_stream_specifier]"
\&\fIstream_type\fR is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's'
for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video
streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
thumbnails or cover arts. If \fIadditional_stream_specifier\fR is used, then
it matches streams which both have this type and match the
\&\fIadditional_stream_specifier\fR. Otherwise, it matches all streams of the
specified type.
.IP \fBp:\fR\fIprogram_id\fR\fB[:\fR\fIadditional_stream_specifier\fR\fB]\fR 4
.IX Item "p:program_id[:additional_stream_specifier]"
Matches streams which are in the program with the id \fIprogram_id\fR. If
\&\fIadditional_stream_specifier\fR is used, then it matches streams which both
are part of the program and match the \fIadditional_stream_specifier\fR.
.IP "\fB#\fR\fIstream_id\fR \fBor i:\fR\fIstream_id\fR" 4
.IX Item "#stream_id or i:stream_id"
Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).
.IP \fBm:\fR\fIkey\fR\fB[:\fR\fIvalue\fR\fB]\fR 4
.IX Item "m:key[:value]"
Matches streams with the metadata tag \fIkey\fR having the specified value. If
\&\fIvalue\fR is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.
.IP \fBu\fR 4
.IX Item "u"
Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the
essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.
.Sp
Note that in \fBffmpeg\fR, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.

.PD
Select an encoder (when used before an output file) or a decoder (when used
before an input file) for one or more streams. \fIcodec\fR is the name of a
decoder/encoder or a special value \f(CW\*(C`copy\*(C'\fR (output only) to indicate that
the stream is not to be re-encoded.
.Sp
For example
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-map 0 \-c:v libx264 \-c:a copy OUTPUT
.Ve
.Sp
encodes all video streams with libx264 and copies all audio streams.
.Sp
For each stream, the last matching \f(CW\*(C`c\*(C'\fR option is applied, so

.IP "\fB\-fs\fR \fIlimit_size\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fs limit_size (output)"
Set the file size limit, expressed in bytes. No further chunk of bytes is written
after the limit is exceeded. The size of the output file is slightly more than the
requested file size.
.IP "\fB\-ss\fR \fIposition\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput/output\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ss position (input/output)"
When used as an input option (before \f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR), seeks in this input file to
\&\fIposition\fR. Note that in most formats it is not possible to seek exactly,
so \fBffmpeg\fR will seek to the closest seek point before \fIposition\fR.
When transcoding and \fB\-accurate_seek\fR is enabled (the default), this
extra segment between the seek point and \fIposition\fR will be decoded and
discarded. When doing stream copy or when \fB\-noaccurate_seek\fR is used, it
will be preserved.
.Sp
When used as an output option (before an output url), decodes but discards
input until the timestamps reach \fIposition\fR.

.IP "\fB\-sseof\fR \fIposition\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-sseof position (input)"
Like the \f(CW\*(C`\-ss\*(C'\fR option but relative to the "end of file". That is negative
values are earlier in the file, 0 is at EOF.
.IP "\fB\-isync\fR \fIinput_index\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-isync input_index (input)"
Assign an input as a sync source.
.Sp
This will take the difference between the start times of the target and reference inputs and
offset the timestamps of the target file by that difference. The source timestamps of the two
inputs should derive from the same clock source for expected results. If \f(CW\*(C`copyts\*(C'\fR is set
then \f(CW\*(C`start_at_zero\*(C'\fR must also be set. If either of the inputs has no starting timestamp
then no sync adjustment is made.
.Sp
Acceptable values are those that refer to a valid ffmpeg input index. If the sync reference is
the target index itself or \fI\-1\fR, then no adjustment is made to target timestamps. A sync
reference may not itself be synced to any other input.
.Sp
Default value is \fI\-1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-itsoffset\fR \fIoffset\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-itsoffset offset (input)"
Set the input time offset.
.Sp
\&\fIoffset\fR must be a time duration specification,
see \fBthe Time duration section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR.
.Sp
The offset is added to the timestamps of the input files. Specifying
a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are delayed by
the time duration specified in \fIoffset\fR.
.IP "\fB\-itsscale\fR \fIscale\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput,per\-stream\fR\fB)\fR" 4

.IX Item "-metadata[:metadata_specifier] key=value (output,per-metadata)"
Set a metadata key/value pair.
.Sp
An optional \fImetadata_specifier\fR may be given to set metadata
on streams, chapters or programs. See \f(CW\*(C`\-map_metadata\*(C'\fR
documentation for details.
.Sp
This option overrides metadata set with \f(CW\*(C`\-map_metadata\*(C'\fR. It is
also possible to delete metadata by using an empty value.
.Sp
For example, for setting the title in the output file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-metadata title="my title" out.flv
.Ve
.Sp
To set the language of the first audio stream:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-metadata:s:a:0 language=eng OUTPUT
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-disposition[:stream_specifier]\fR \fIvalue\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput,per\-stream\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-disposition[:stream_specifier] value (output,per-stream)"
Sets the disposition for a stream.
.Sp
By default, the disposition is copied from the input stream, unless the output
stream this option applies to is fed by a complex filtergraph \- in that case the
disposition is unset by default.
.Sp
\&\fIvalue\fR is a sequence of items separated by '+' or '\-'. The first item may
also be prefixed with '+' or '\-', in which case this option modifies the default
value. Otherwise (the first item is not prefixed) this options overrides the
default value. A '+' prefix adds the given disposition, '\-' removes it. It is
also possible to clear the disposition by setting it to 0.
.Sp
If no \f(CW\*(C`\-disposition\*(C'\fR options were specified for an output file, ffmpeg will
automatically set the 'default' disposition on the first stream of each type,
when there are multiple streams of this type in the output file and no stream of
that type is already marked as default.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\-dispositions\*(C'\fR option lists the known dispositions.
.Sp
For example, to make the second audio stream the default stream:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.mkv \-c copy \-disposition:a:1 default out.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
To make the second subtitle stream the default stream and remove the default
disposition from the first subtitle stream:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.mkv \-c copy \-disposition:s:0 0 \-disposition:s:1 default out.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
To add an embedded cover/thumbnail:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.mp4 \-i IMAGE \-map 0 \-map 1 \-c copy \-c:v:1 png \-disposition:v:1 attached_pic out.mp4
.Ve
.Sp
Not all muxers support embedded thumbnails, and those who do, only support a few formats, like JPEG or PNG.

.IP "\fB\-target\fR \fItype\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-target type (output)"
Specify target file type (\f(CW\*(C`vcd\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`svcd\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dvd\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dv\*(C'\fR,

\&\f(CW\*(C`film\-\*(C'\fR to use the corresponding standard. All the format options
(bitrate, codecs, buffer sizes) are then set automatically. You can just type:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i myfile.avi \-target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg

This boolean option determines if the filtergraph(s) to which this stream is fed gets
reinitialized when input frame parameters change mid-stream. This option is enabled by
default as most video and all audio filters cannot handle deviation in input frame properties.
Upon reinitialization, existing filter state is lost, like e.g. the frame count \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR

Add an attachment to the output file. This is supported by a few formats

are implemented as a specific type of stream, so this option will add
a new stream to the file. It is then possible to use per-stream options

option will be created after all the other streams (i.e. those created
with \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR or automatic mappings).

Extract the matching attachment stream into a file named \fIfilename\fR. If
\&\fIfilename\fR is empty, then the value of the \f(CW\*(C`filename\*(C'\fR metadata tag
will be used.
.Sp
E.g. to extract the first attachment to a file named 'out.ttf':
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-dump_attachment:t:0 out.ttf \-i INPUT
.Ve
.Sp

.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-dump_attachment:t "" \-i INPUT

Technical note \-\- attachments are implemented as codec extradata, so this
option can actually be used to extract extradata from any stream, not just
attachments.

.RS 4

.IX Item "time[,time...]"
If the argument consists of timestamps, ffmpeg will round the specified times to the nearest
output timestamp as per the encoder time base and force a keyframe at the first frame having
timestamp equal or greater than the computed timestamp. Note that if the encoder time base is too
coarse, then the keyframes may be forced on frames with timestamps lower than the specified time.
The default encoder time base is the inverse of the output framerate but may be set otherwise
via \f(CW\*(C`\-enc_time_base\*(C'\fR.

If one of the times is "\f(CW\*(C`chapters\*(C'\fR[\fIdelta\fR]", it is expanded into

This lowers the latency of subtitles for which the end packet or the following

to duplication of subtitle events in order to cover the full duration, so
when dealing with use cases where latency of when the subtitle event is passed
on to output is not relevant this option should not be utilized.

.IX Item "-map [-]input_file_id[:stream_specifier][?] | [linklabel] (output)"
Create one or more streams in the output file. This option has two forms for

complex filtergraph (specified with \f(CW\*(C`\-filter_complex\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-filter_complex_script\*(C'\fR).
.Sp
In the first form, an output stream is created for every stream from the input
file with the index \fIinput_file_id\fR. If \fIstream_specifier\fR is given,
only those streams that match the specifier are used (see the
\&\fBStream specifiers\fR section for the \fIstream_specifier\fR syntax).
.Sp
A \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR character before the stream identifier creates a "negative" mapping.
It disables matching streams from already created mappings.
.Sp
A trailing \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR after the stream index will allow the map to be
optional: if the map matches no streams the map will be ignored instead
of failing. Note the map will still fail if an invalid input file index
is used; such as if the map refers to a non-existent input.
.Sp
An alternative \fI[linklabel]\fR form will map outputs from complex filter
graphs (see the \fB\-filter_complex\fR option) to the output file.
\&\fIlinklabel\fR must correspond to a defined output link label in the graph.
.Sp
This option may be specified multiple times, each adding more streams to the
output file. Any given input stream may also be mapped any number of times as a
source for different output streams, e.g. in order to use different encoding
options and/or filters. The streams are created in the output in the same order

Map an audio channel from a given input to an output. If

be mapped on all the audio streams.
.Sp
Using "\-1" instead of
\&\fIinput_file_id\fR.\fIstream_specifier\fR.\fIchannel_id\fR will map a muted
channel.
.Sp
A trailing \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR will allow the map_channel to be
optional: if the map_channel matches no channel the map_channel will be ignored instead
of failing.
.Sp
For example, assuming \fIINPUT\fR is a stereo audio file, you can switch the
two audio channels with the following command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-map_channel 0.0.1 \-map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to mute the first channel and keep the second:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-map_channel \-1 \-map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT
.Ve
.Sp
The order of the "\-map_channel" option specifies the order of the channels in
the output stream. The output channel layout is guessed from the number of
channels mapped (mono if one "\-map_channel", stereo if two, etc.). Using "\-ac"
in combination of "\-map_channel" makes the channel gain levels to be updated if
input and output channel layouts don't match (for instance two "\-map_channel"
options and "\-ac 6").
.Sp
You can also extract each channel of an input to specific outputs; the following
command extracts two channels of the \fIINPUT\fR audio stream (file 0, stream 0)
to the respective \fIOUTPUT_CH0\fR and \fIOUTPUT_CH1\fR outputs:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT_CH0 \-map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT_CH1
.Ve
.Sp
The following example splits the channels of a stereo input into two separate
streams, which are put into the same output file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i stereo.wav \-map 0:0 \-map 0:0 \-map_channel 0.0.0:0.0 \-map_channel 0.0.1:0.1 \-y out.ogg
.Ve
.Sp
Note that currently each output stream can only contain channels from a single
input stream; you can't for example use "\-map_channel" to pick multiple input
audio channels contained in different streams (from the same or different files)
and merge them into a single output stream. It is therefore not currently
possible, for example, to turn two separate mono streams into a single stereo
stream. However splitting a stereo stream into two single channel mono streams
is possible.
.Sp
If you need this feature, a possible workaround is to use the \fIamerge\fR
filter. For example, if you need to merge a media (here \fIinput.mkv\fR) with 2
mono audio streams into one single stereo channel audio stream (and keep the
video stream), you can use the following command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i input.mkv \-filter_complex "[0:1] [0:2] amerge" \-c:a pcm_s16le \-c:v copy output.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
To map the first two audio channels from the first input, and using the
trailing \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR, ignore the audio channel mapping if the first input is
mono instead of stereo:

If metadata specifier is omitted, it defaults to global.

By default, global metadata is copied from the first input file,
per-stream and per-chapter metadata is copied along with streams/chapters. These
default mappings are disabled by creating any mapping of the relevant type. A negative
file index can be used to create a dummy mapping that just disables automatic copying.

.IP "\fB\-shortest (\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shortest (output)"
Finish encoding when the shortest output stream ends.
.Sp
Note that this option may require buffering frames, which introduces extra
latency. The maximum amount of this latency may be controlled with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-shortest_buf_duration\*(C'\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-shortest_buf_duration\fR \fIduration\fR \fB(\fR\fIoutput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shortest_buf_duration duration (output)"
The \f(CW\*(C`\-shortest\*(C'\fR option may require buffering potentially large amounts
of data when at least one of the streams is "sparse" (i.e. has large gaps
between frames – this is typically the case for subtitles).
.Sp
This option controls the maximum duration of buffered frames in seconds.
Larger values may allow the \f(CW\*(C`\-shortest\*(C'\fR option to produce more accurate
results, but increase memory use and latency.
.Sp
The default value is 10 seconds.
.IP "\fB\-dts_delta_threshold\fR \fIthreshold\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dts_delta_threshold threshold"
Timestamp discontinuity delta threshold, expressed as a decimal number

The timestamp discontinuity correction enabled by this option is only
applied to input formats accepting timestamp discontinuity (for which
the \f(CW\*(C`AV_FMT_DISCONT\*(C'\fR flag is enabled), e.g. MPEG-TS and HLS, and
is automatically disabled when employing the \f(CW\*(C`\-copy_ts\*(C'\fR option
(unless wrapping is detected).
.Sp
If a timestamp discontinuity is detected whose absolute value is
greater than \fIthreshold\fR, ffmpeg will remove the discontinuity by
decreasing/increasing the current DTS and PTS by the corresponding
delta value.
.Sp
The default value is 10.
.IP "\fB\-dts_error_threshold\fR \fIthreshold\fR" 4

If a timestamp discontinuity is detected whose absolute value is
greater than \fIthreshold\fR, ffmpeg will drop the PTS/DTS timestamp

.IX Item "-filter_complex filtergraph (global)"
Define a complex filtergraph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of inputs and/or
outputs. For simple graphs \-\- those with one input and one output of the same
type \-\- see the \fB\-filter\fR options. \fIfiltergraph\fR is a description of
the filtergraph, as described in the ``Filtergraph syntax'' section of the
ffmpeg-filters manual.
.Sp
Input link labels must refer to input streams using the
\&\f(CW\*(C`[file_index:stream_specifier]\*(C'\fR syntax (i.e. the same as \fB\-map\fR
uses). If \fIstream_specifier\fR matches multiple streams, the first one will be
used. An unlabeled input will be connected to the first unused input stream of
the matching type.
.Sp
Output link labels are referred to with \fB\-map\fR. Unlabeled outputs are
added to the first output file.
.Sp
Note that with this option it is possible to use only lavfi sources without
normal input files.
.Sp
For example, to overlay an image over video
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        ffmpeg \-i video.mkv \-i image.png \-filter_complex \*(Aq[0:v][1:v]overlay[out]\*(Aq \-map
\&        \*(Aq[out]\*(Aq out.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
Here \f(CW\*(C`[0:v]\*(C'\fR refers to the first video stream in the first input file,
which is linked to the first (main) input of the overlay filter. Similarly the
first video stream in the second input is linked to the second (overlay) input
of overlay.
.Sp
Assuming there is only one video stream in each input file, we can omit input
labels, so the above is equivalent to
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        ffmpeg \-i video.mkv \-i image.png \-filter_complex \*(Aqoverlay[out]\*(Aq \-map
\&        \*(Aq[out]\*(Aq out.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
Furthermore we can omit the output label and the single output from the filter
graph will be added to the output file automatically, so we can simply write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i video.mkv \-i image.png \-filter_complex \*(Aqoverlay\*(Aq out.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
As a special exception, you can use a bitmap subtitle stream as input: it
will be converted into a video with the same size as the largest video in
the file, or 720x576 if no video is present. Note that this is an
experimental and temporary solution. It will be removed once libavfilter has
proper support for subtitles.
.Sp
For example, to hardcode subtitles on top of a DVB-T recording stored in
MPEG-TS format, delaying the subtitles by 1 second:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        ffmpeg \-i input.ts \-filter_complex \e
\&          \*(Aq[#0x2ef] setpts=PTS+1/TB [sub] ; [#0x2d0] [sub] overlay\*(Aq \e
\&          \-sn \-map \*(Aq#0x2dc\*(Aq output.mkv
.Ve
.Sp
(0x2d0, 0x2dc and 0x2ef are the MPEG-TS PIDs of respectively the video,
audio and subtitles streams; 0:0, 0:3 and 0:7 would have worked too)
.Sp
To generate 5 seconds of pure red video using lavfi \f(CW\*(C`color\*(C'\fR source:

description is to be read.
.IP "\fB\-accurate_seek (\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-accurate_seek (input)"
This option enables or disables accurate seeking in input files with the
\&\fB\-ss\fR option. It is enabled by default, so seeking is accurate when
transcoding. Use \fB\-noaccurate_seek\fR to disable it, which may be useful
e.g. when copying some streams and transcoding the others.
.IP "\fB\-seek_timestamp (\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-seek_timestamp (input)"
This option enables or disables seeking by timestamp in input files with the
\&\fB\-ss\fR option. It is disabled by default. If enabled, the argument
to the \fB\-ss\fR option is considered an actual timestamp, and is not
offset by the start time of the file. This matters only for files which do
not start from timestamp 0, such as transport streams.
.IP "\fB\-thread_queue_size\fR \fIsize\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput/output\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "-thread_queue_size size (input/output)"
For input, this option sets the maximum number of queued packets when reading
from the file or device. With low latency / high rate live streams, packets may
be discarded if they are not read in a timely manner; setting this value can
force ffmpeg to use a separate input thread and read packets as soon as they
arrive. By default ffmpeg only does this if multiple inputs are specified.
.Sp
For output, this option specified the maximum number of packets that may be
queued to each muxing thread.
.IP "\fB\-sdp_file\fR \fIfile\fR \fB(\fR\fIglobal\fR\fB)\fR" 4

When transcoding audio and/or video streams, ffmpeg will not begin writing into
the output until it has one packet for each such stream. While waiting for that
to happen, packets for other streams are buffered. This option sets the size of
this buffer, in packets, for the matching output stream.

The default value of this option should be high enough for most uses, so only
touch this option if you are sure that you need it.

.SS "Preset files"
.IX Subsection "Preset files"
A preset file contains a sequence of \fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs,
one for each line, specifying a sequence of options which would be
awkward to specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash
('#') character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check
the \fIpresets\fR directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.
.PP
There are two types of preset files: ffpreset and avpreset files.
.PP
\fIffpreset files\fR
.IX Subsection "ffpreset files"
.PP
ffpreset files are specified with the \f(CW\*(C`vpre\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`apre\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`spre\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`fpre\*(C'\fR options. The \f(CW\*(C`fpre\*(C'\fR option takes the
filename of the preset instead of a preset name as input and can be
used for any kind of codec. For the \f(CW\*(C`vpre\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`apre\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`spre\*(C'\fR options, the options specified in a preset file are
applied to the currently selected codec of the same type as the preset
option.
.PP
The argument passed to the \f(CW\*(C`vpre\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`apre\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`spre\*(C'\fR
preset options identifies the preset file to use according to the
following rules:
.PP
First ffmpeg searches for a file named \fIarg\fR.ffpreset in the
directories \fR\f(CI$FFMPEG_DATADIR\fR\fI\fR (if set), and \fI\fR\f(CI$HOME\fR\fI/.ffmpeg\fR, and in
the datadir defined at configuration time (usually \fIPREFIX/share/ffmpeg\fR)
or in a \fIffpresets\fR folder along the executable on win32,
in that order. For example, if the argument is \f(CW\*(C`libvpx\-1080p\*(C'\fR, it will
search for the file \fIlibvpx\-1080p.ffpreset\fR.
.PP
If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
\&\fIcodec_name\fR\-\fIarg\fR.ffpreset in the above-mentioned
directories, where \fIcodec_name\fR is the name of the codec to which
the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select
the video codec with \f(CW\*(C`\-vcodec libvpx\*(C'\fR and use \f(CW\*(C`\-vpre 1080p\*(C'\fR,
then it will search for the file \fIlibvpx\-1080p.ffpreset\fR.
.PP
\fIavpreset files\fR
.IX Subsection "avpreset files"
.PP
avpreset files are specified with the \f(CW\*(C`pre\*(C'\fR option. They work similar to
ffpreset files, but they only allow encoder\- specific options. Therefore, an
\&\fIoption\fR=\fIvalue\fR pair specifying an encoder cannot be used.
.PP
When the \f(CW\*(C`pre\*(C'\fR option is specified, ffmpeg will look for files with the
suffix .avpreset in the directories \fR\f(CI$AVCONV_DATADIR\fR\fI\fR (if set), and
\&\fI\fR\f(CI$HOME\fR\fI/.avconv\fR, and in the datadir defined at configuration time (usually
\&\fIPREFIX/share/ffmpeg\fR), in that order.
.PP
First ffmpeg searches for a file named \fIcodec_name\fR\-\fIarg\fR.avpreset in
the above-mentioned directories, where \fIcodec_name\fR is the name of the codec
to which the preset file options will be applied. For example, if you select the
video codec with \f(CW\*(C`\-vcodec libvpx\*(C'\fR and use \f(CW\*(C`\-pre 1080p\*(C'\fR, then it will
search for the file \fIlibvpx\-1080p.avpreset\fR.
.PP
If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named

.SS "Video and Audio grabbing"
.IX Subsection "Video and Audio grabbing"
If you specify the input format and device then ffmpeg can grab video
and audio directly.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f oss \-i /dev/dsp \-f video4linux2 \-i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg
.Ve
.PP
Or with an ALSA audio source (mono input, card id 1) instead of OSS:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f alsa \-ac 1 \-i hw:1 \-f video4linux2 \-i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg
.Ve
.PP
Note that you must activate the right video source and channel before
launching ffmpeg with any TV viewer such as
<\fBhttp://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/\fR> by Gerd Knorr. You also
have to set the audio recording levels correctly with a
standard mixer.
.SS "X11 grabbing"
.IX Subsection "X11 grabbing"
Grab the X11 display with ffmpeg via
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f x11grab \-video_size cif \-framerate 25 \-i :0.0 /tmp/out.mpg
.Ve
.PP
0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as
the DISPLAY environment variable.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f x11grab \-video_size cif \-framerate 25 \-i :0.0+10,20 /tmp/out.mpg
.Ve
.PP
0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY environment
variable. 10 is the x\-offset and 20 the y\-offset for the grabbing.
.SS "Video and Audio file format conversion"
.IX Subsection "Video and Audio file format conversion"
Any supported file format and protocol can serve as input to ffmpeg:
.PP
Examples:
.IP \(bu 4
You can use YUV files as input:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i /tmp/test%d.Y /tmp/out.mpg
.Ve
.Sp
It will use the files:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        /tmp/test0.Y, /tmp/test0.U, /tmp/test0.V,
\&        /tmp/test1.Y, /tmp/test1.U, /tmp/test1.V, etc...
.Ve
.Sp
The Y files use twice the resolution of the U and V files. They are
raw files, without header. They can be generated by all decent video
decoders. You must specify the size of the image with the \fB\-s\fR option
if ffmpeg cannot guess it.
.IP \(bu 4
You can input from a raw YUV420P file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i /tmp/test.yuv /tmp/out.avi
.Ve
.Sp
test.yuv is a file containing raw YUV planar data. Each frame is composed
of the Y plane followed by the U and V planes at half vertical and
horizontal resolution.
.IP \(bu 4
You can output to a raw YUV420P file:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i mydivx.avi hugefile.yuv
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
You can set several input files and output files:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i /tmp/a.wav \-s 640x480 \-i /tmp/a.yuv /tmp/a.mpg
.Ve
.Sp
Converts the audio file a.wav and the raw YUV video file a.yuv
to MPEG file a.mpg.
.IP \(bu 4
You can also do audio and video conversions at the same time:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i /tmp/a.wav \-ar 22050 /tmp/a.mp2
.Ve
.Sp
Converts a.wav to MPEG audio at 22050 Hz sample rate.
.IP \(bu 4
You can encode to several formats at the same time and define a
mapping from input stream to output streams:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i /tmp/a.wav \-map 0:a \-b:a 64k /tmp/a.mp2 \-map 0:a \-b:a 128k /tmp/b.mp2
.Ve
.Sp
Converts a.wav to a.mp2 at 64 kbits and to b.mp2 at 128 kbits. '\-map
file:index' specifies which input stream is used for each output
stream, in the order of the definition of output streams.
.IP \(bu 4
You can transcode decrypted VOBs:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i snatch_1.vob \-f avi \-c:v mpeg4 \-b:v 800k \-g 300 \-bf 2 \-c:a libmp3lame \-b:a 128k snatch.avi
.Ve
.Sp
This is a typical DVD ripping example; the input is a VOB file, the
output an AVI file with MPEG\-4 video and MP3 audio. Note that in this
command we use B\-frames so the MPEG\-4 stream is DivX5 compatible, and
GOP size is 300 which means one intra frame every 10 seconds for 29.97fps
input video. Furthermore, the audio stream is MP3\-encoded so you need
to enable LAME support by passing \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libmp3lame\*(C'\fR to configure.
The mapping is particularly useful for DVD transcoding
to get the desired audio language.
.Sp
NOTE: To see the supported input formats, use \f(CW\*(C`ffmpeg \-demuxers\*(C'\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
You can extract images from a video, or create a video from many images:
.Sp
For extracting images from a video:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i foo.avi \-r 1 \-s WxH \-f image2 foo\-%03d.jpeg
.Ve
.Sp
This will extract one video frame per second from the video and will
output them in files named \fIfoo\-001.jpeg\fR, \fIfoo\-002.jpeg\fR,
etc. Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.
.Sp
If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use the
above command in combination with the \f(CW\*(C`\-frames:v\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR option,
or in combination with \-ss to start extracting from a certain point in time.
.Sp
For creating a video from many images:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f image2 \-framerate 12 \-i foo\-%03d.jpeg \-s WxH foo.avi
.Ve
.Sp
The syntax \f(CW\*(C`foo\-%03d.jpeg\*(C'\fR specifies to use a decimal number
composed of three digits padded with zeroes to express the sequence
number. It is the same syntax supported by the C printf function, but
only formats accepting a normal integer are suitable.
.Sp
When importing an image sequence, \-i also supports expanding
shell-like wildcard patterns (globbing) internally, by selecting the
image2\-specific \f(CW\*(C`\-pattern_type glob\*(C'\fR option.
.Sp
For example, for creating a video from filenames matching the glob pattern
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\-*.jpeg\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f image2 \-pattern_type glob \-framerate 12 \-i \*(Aqfoo\-*.jpeg\*(Aq \-s WxH foo.avi
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
You can put many streams of the same type in the output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i test1.avi \-i test2.avi \-map 1:1 \-map 1:0 \-map 0:1 \-map 0:0 \-c copy \-y test12.nut
.Ve
.Sp
The resulting output file \fItest12.nut\fR will contain the first four streams
from the input files in reverse order.
.IP \(bu 4
To force CBR video output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i myfile.avi \-b 4000k \-minrate 4000k \-maxrate 4000k \-bufsize 1835k out.m2v
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
The four options lmin, lmax, mblmin and mblmax use 'lambda' units,
but you may use the QP2LAMBDA constant to easily convert from 'q' units:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i src.ext \-lmax 21*QP2LAMBDA dst.ext
.Ve
.SH SYNTAX
.IX Header "SYNTAX"
This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.
.SS "Quoting and escaping"
.IX Subsection "Quoting and escaping"
FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:
.IP \(bu 4
\&\fB'\fR and \fB\e\fR are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.
.IP \(bu 4
A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a \fB\e\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
All characters enclosed between \fB''\fR are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character \fB'\fR itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.
.IP \(bu 4
Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.
.PP
Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.
.PP
The function \f(CW\*(C`av_get_token\*(C'\fR defined in
\&\fIlibavutil/avstring.h\fR can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.
.PP
The tool \fItools/ffescape\fR in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR
.IX Subsection "Examples"
.IP \(bu 4
Escape the string \f(CW\*(C`Crime d\*(AqAmour\*(C'\fR containing the \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR special
character:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        Crime d\e\*(AqAmour
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
The string above contains a quote, so the \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(AqCrime d\*(Aq\e\*(Aq\*(AqAmour\*(Aq
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(Aq  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  \*(Aq
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(Aq The string \*(Aq\e\*(Aqstring\e\*(Aq\*(Aq is a string \*(Aq
.Ve
.IP \(bu 4
To include a literal \fB\e\fR you can use either escaping or quoting:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(Aqc:\efoo\*(Aq can be written as c:\e\efoo
.Ve
.SS Date
.IX Subsection "Date"
The accepted syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        [(YYYY\-MM\-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
\&        now
.Ve
.PP
If the value is "now" it takes the current time.
.PP
Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as UTC.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.
.SS "Time duration"
.IX Subsection "Time duration"
There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [\-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIHH\fR expresses the number of hours, \fIMM\fR the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and \fISS\fR the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The \fIm\fR at the end expresses decimal value for
\&\fISS\fR.
.PP
\&\fIor\fR
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        [\-]<S>+[.<m>...][s|ms|us]
.Ve
.PP
\&\fIS\fR expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
\&\fIm\fR.  The optional literal suffixes \fBs\fR, \fBms\fR or \fBus\fR
indicate to interpret the value as seconds, milliseconds or microseconds,
respectively.
.PP
In both expressions, the optional \fB\-\fR indicates negative duration.
.PP
\fIExamples\fR

.PP
A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by '+'.
Each term can be:
.IP \(bu 4
the name of a single channel (e.g. \fBFL\fR, \fBFR\fR, \fBFC\fR, \fBLFE\fR, etc.),
each optionally containing a custom name after a '@', (e.g. \fBFL@Left\fR,
\&\fBFR@Right\fR, \fBFC@Center\fR, \fBLFE@Low_Frequency\fR, etc.)
.PP
A standard channel layout can be specified by the following:
.IP \(bu 4
the name of a single channel (e.g. \fBFL\fR, \fBFR\fR, \fBFC\fR, \fBLFE\fR, etc.)
.IP \(bu 4
the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. \fBmono\fR,
\&\fBstereo\fR, \fB4.0\fR, \fBquad\fR, \fB5.0\fR, etc.)
.IP \(bu 4
a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'c', yielding the default channel
layout for that number of channels (see the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`av_channel_layout_default\*(C'\fR). Note that not all channel counts have a
default layout.
.IP \(bu 4
a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'C', yielding an unknown channel
layout with the specified number of channels. Note that not all channel layout
specification strings support unknown channel layouts.
.IP \(bu 4
a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x" (see the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AV_CH_*\*(C'\fR macros in \fIlibavutil/channel_layout.h\fR.
.PP
Before libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to specify a number of
channels was optional, but now it is required, while a channel layout mask can
also be specified as a decimal number (if and only if not followed by "c" or "C").
.PP
See also the function \f(CW\*(C`av_channel_layout_from_string\*(C'\fR defined in
\&\fIlibavutil/channel_layout.h\fR.
.SH "EXPRESSION EVALUATION"
.IX Header "EXPRESSION EVALUATION"
When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the \fIlibavutil/eval.h\fR
interface.
.PP
An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.
.PP
Two expressions \fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR can be combined to form
another expression "\fIexpr1\fR;\fIexpr2\fR".
\&\fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR are evaluated in turn, and the new
expression evaluates to the value of \fIexpr2\fR.
.PP
The following binary operators are available: \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`^\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The following unary operators are available: \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The following functions are available:
.IP \fBabs(x)\fR 4
.IX Item "abs(x)"
Compute absolute value of \fIx\fR.
.IP \fBacos(x)\fR 4
.IX Item "acos(x)"

Compute arctangent of \fIx\fR.
.IP "\fBatan2(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "atan2(x, y)"
Compute principal value of the arc tangent of \fIy\fR/\fIx\fR.
.IP "\fBbetween(x, min, max)\fR" 4
.IX Item "between(x, min, max)"
Return 1 if \fIx\fR is greater than or equal to \fImin\fR and lesser than or
equal to \fImax\fR, 0 otherwise.
.IP "\fBbitand(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "bitand(x, y)"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBbitor(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "bitor(x, y)"
.PD
Compute bitwise and/or operation on \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR.
.Sp
The results of the evaluation of \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR are converted to
integers before executing the bitwise operation.
.Sp
Note that both the conversion to integer and the conversion back to
floating point can lose precision. Beware of unexpected results for
large numbers (usually 2^53 and larger).
.IP \fBceil(expr)\fR 4
.IX Item "ceil(expr)"
Round the value of expression \fIexpr\fR upwards to the nearest
integer. For example, "ceil(1.5)" is "2.0".
.IP "\fBclip(x, min, max)\fR" 4
.IX Item "clip(x, min, max)"
Return the value of \fIx\fR clipped between \fImin\fR and \fImax\fR.
.IP \fBcos(x)\fR 4
.IX Item "cos(x)"
Compute cosine of \fIx\fR.
.IP \fBcosh(x)\fR 4
.IX Item "cosh(x)"
Compute hyperbolic cosine of \fIx\fR.
.IP "\fBeq(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "eq(x, y)"
Return 1 if \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR are equivalent, 0 otherwise.
.IP \fBexp(x)\fR 4
.IX Item "exp(x)"
Compute exponential of \fIx\fR (with base \f(CW\*(C`e\*(C'\fR, the Euler's number).
.IP \fBfloor(expr)\fR 4
.IX Item "floor(expr)"
Round the value of expression \fIexpr\fR downwards to the nearest
integer. For example, "floor(\-1.5)" is "\-2.0".
.IP \fBgauss(x)\fR 4
.IX Item "gauss(x)"
Compute Gauss function of \fIx\fR, corresponding to
\&\f(CW\*(C`exp(\-x*x/2) / sqrt(2*PI)\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fBgcd(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "gcd(x, y)"
Return the greatest common divisor of \fIx\fR and \fIy\fR. If both \fIx\fR and
\&\fIy\fR are 0 or either or both are less than zero then behavior is undefined.
.IP "\fBgt(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "gt(x, y)"
Return 1 if \fIx\fR is greater than \fIy\fR, 0 otherwise.
.IP "\fBgte(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "gte(x, y)"
Return 1 if \fIx\fR is greater than or equal to \fIy\fR, 0 otherwise.
.IP "\fBhypot(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "hypot(x, y)"

.IX Item "if(x, y, z)"
Evaluate \fIx\fR, and if the result is non-zero return the evaluation
result of \fIy\fR, otherwise the evaluation result of \fIz\fR.
.IP "\fBifnot(x, y)\fR" 4
.IX Item "ifnot(x, y)"
Evaluate \fIx\fR, and if the result is zero return the result of the
evaluation of \fIy\fR, return 0 otherwise.
.IP "\fBifnot(x, y, z)\fR" 4
.IX Item "ifnot(x, y, z)"
Evaluate \fIx\fR, and if the result is zero return the evaluation
result of \fIy\fR, otherwise the evaluation result of \fIz\fR.
.IP \fBisinf(x)\fR 4

Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
value, note that:
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`*\*(C'\fR works like AND
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR works like OR
.PP
For example the construct:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        if (A AND B) then C
.Ve
.PP
is equivalent to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        if(A*B, C)
.Ve
.PP
In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.
.PP
The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB',
\&'G' and 'B' as number postfix.
.PP
The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

.SH "CODEC OPTIONS"
.IX Header "CODEC OPTIONS"
libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.
.PP
Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVCodecContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR API
for programmatic use.
.PP

Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1\-pass mode, bitrate
tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the
target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max

This encoder is the default AAC encoder, natively implemented into FFmpeg.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.IP \fBb\fR 4
.IX Item "b"
Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode. If this option is unspecified it is set to 128kbps.
.IP \fBq\fR 4
.IX Item "q"
Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the \fBffmpeg\fR command-line tool. For library interface users, use
\&\fBglobal_quality\fR.
.IP \fBcutoff\fR 4
.IX Item "cutoff"
Set cutoff frequency. If unspecified will allow the encoder to dynamically
adjust the cutoff to improve clarity on low bitrates.
.IP \fBaac_coder\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_coder"
Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:
.RS 4
.IP \fBtwoloop\fR 4
.IX Item "twoloop"
Two loop searching (TLS) method. This is the default method.
.Sp
This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.  Will tune
itself based on whether \fBaac_is\fR, \fBaac_ms\fR and \fBaac_pns\fR
are enabled.
.IP \fBanmr\fR 4
.IX Item "anmr"
Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.
.Sp
This is an experimental coder which currently produces a lower quality, is more
unstable and is slower than the default twoloop coder but has potential.
Currently has no support for the \fBaac_is\fR or \fBaac_pns\fR options.
Not currently recommended.
.IP \fBfast\fR 4
.IX Item "fast"
Constant quantizer method.
.Sp
Uses a cheaper version of twoloop algorithm that doesn't try to do as many
clever adjustments. Worse with low bitrates (less than 64kbps), but is better
and much faster at higher bitrates.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP \fBaac_ms\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_ms"
Sets mid/side coding mode. The default value of "auto" will automatically use
M/S with bands which will benefit from such coding. Can be forced for all bands
using the value "enable", which is mainly useful for debugging or disabled using
"disable".
.IP \fBaac_is\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_is"
Sets intensity stereo coding tool usage. By default, it's enabled and will
automatically toggle IS for similar pairs of stereo bands if it's beneficial.
Can be disabled for debugging by setting the value to "disable".
.IP \fBaac_pns\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_pns"
Uses perceptual noise substitution to replace low entropy high frequency bands
with imperceptible white noise during the decoding process. By default, it's
enabled, but can be disabled for debugging purposes by using "disable".
.IP \fBaac_tns\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_tns"
Enables the use of a multitap FIR filter which spans through the high frequency
bands to hide quantization noise during the encoding process and is reverted
by the decoder. As well as decreasing unpleasant artifacts in the high range
this also reduces the entropy in the high bands and allows for more bits to
be used by the mid-low bands. By default it's enabled but can be disabled for
debugging by setting the option to "disable".
.IP \fBaac_ltp\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_ltp"
Enables the use of the long term prediction extension which increases coding
efficiency in very low bandwidth situations such as encoding of voice or
solo piano music by extending constant harmonic peaks in bands throughout
frames. This option is implied by profile:a aac_low and is incompatible with
aac_pred. Use in conjunction with \fB\-ar\fR to decrease the samplerate.
.IP \fBaac_pred\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_pred"
Enables the use of a more traditional style of prediction where the spectral
coefficients transmitted are replaced by the difference of the current
coefficients minus the previous "predicted" coefficients. In theory and sometimes
in practice this can improve quality for low to mid bitrate audio.
This option implies the aac_main profile and is incompatible with aac_ltp.
.IP \fBprofile\fR 4
.IX Item "profile"
Sets the encoding profile, possible values:
.RS 4
.IP \fBaac_low\fR 4
.IX Item "aac_low"

sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

.SS libshine
.IX Subsection "libshine"
Shine Fixed-Point MP3 encoder wrapper.
.PP
Shine is a fixed-point MP3 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.
.PP
This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.
.PP
The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at

updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at <\fBhttps://github.com/savonet/shine\fR>.

.SS libaom\-av1
.IX Subsection "libaom-av1"
libaom AV1 encoder wrapper.
.PP
Requires the presence of the libaom headers and library during
configuration.  You need to explicitly configure the build with
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libaom\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.PP
The wrapper supports the following standard libavcodec options:
.IP \fBb\fR 4
.IX Item "b"
Set bitrate target in bits/second.  By default this will use
variable-bitrate mode.  If \fBmaxrate\fR and \fBminrate\fR are
also set to the same value then it will use constant-bitrate mode,
otherwise if \fBcrf\fR is set as well then it will use
constrained-quality mode.
.IP "\fBg keyint_min\fR" 4
.IX Item "g keyint_min"
Set key frame placement.  The GOP size sets the maximum distance between
key frames; if zero the output stream will be intra-only.  The minimum
distance is ignored unless it is the same as the GOP size, in which case
key frames will always appear at a fixed interval.  Not set by default,
so without this option the library has completely free choice about
where to place key frames.
.IP "\fBqmin qmax\fR" 4
.IX Item "qmin qmax"
Set minimum/maximum quantisation values.  Valid range is from 0 to 63
(warning: this does not match the quantiser values actually used by AV1
\&\- divide by four to map real quantiser values to this range).  Defaults
to min/max (no constraint).
.IP "\fBminrate maxrate bufsize rc_init_occupancy\fR" 4
.IX Item "minrate maxrate bufsize rc_init_occupancy"
Set rate control buffering parameters.  Not used if not set \- defaults
to unconstrained variable bitrate.
.IP \fBthreads\fR 4
.IX Item "threads"
Set the number of threads to use while encoding.  This may require the
\&\fBtiles\fR or \fBrow-mt\fR options to also be set to actually
use the specified number of threads fully. Defaults to the number of
hardware threads supported by the host machine.
.IP \fBprofile\fR 4
.IX Item "profile"
Set the encoding profile.  Defaults to using the profile which matches
the bit depth and chroma subsampling of the input.
.PP
The wrapper also has some specific options:
.IP \fBcpu-used\fR 4
.IX Item "cpu-used"
Set the quality/encoding speed tradeoff.  Valid range is from 0 to 8,
higher numbers indicating greater speed and lower quality.  The default
value is 1, which will be slow and high quality.
.IP \fBauto-alt-ref\fR 4

output size.  Only used if set; by default only the bitrate target is
used.
.IP \fBstatic-thresh\fR 4
.IX Item "static-thresh"
Set a change threshold on blocks below which they will be skipped by
the encoder.  Defined in arbitrary units as a nonnegative integer,
defaulting to zero (no blocks are skipped).
.IP \fBdrop-threshold\fR 4
.IX Item "drop-threshold"
Set a threshold for dropping frames when close to rate control bounds.
Defined as a percentage of the target buffer \- when the rate control
buffer falls below this percentage, frames will be dropped until it
has refilled above the threshold.  Defaults to zero (no frames are
dropped).
.IP "\fBdenoise-noise-level (\fR\fIlevel\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "denoise-noise-level (level)"
Amount of noise to be removed for grain synthesis. Grain synthesis is disabled if
this option is not set or set to 0.

.IX Item "frame-parallel (boolean)"
Enable frame parallel decodability features. Default is true.
.IP \fBtiles\fR 4
.IX Item "tiles"
Set the number of tiles to encode the input video with, as columns x
rows.  Larger numbers allow greater parallelism in both encoding and
decoding, but may decrease coding efficiency.  Defaults to the minimum

.PP
The libjxl wrapper supports the following options:
.IP \fBdistance\fR 4
.IX Item "distance"
Set the target Butteraugli distance. This is a quality setting: lower
distance yields higher quality, with distance=1.0 roughly comparable to
libjpeg Quality 90 for photographic content. Setting distance=0.0 yields
true lossless encoding. Valid values range between 0.0 and 15.0, and sane
values rarely exceed 5.0. Setting distance=0.1 usually attains
transparency for most input. The default is 1.0.
.IP \fBeffort\fR 4

Set the encoding effort used. Higher effort values produce more consistent
quality and usually produces a better quality/bpp curve, at the cost of
more CPU time required. Valid values range from 1 to 9, and the default is 7.

.IX Subsection "libwebp"
libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper
.PP
libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.
.PP
\fIPixel Format\fR
.IX Subsection "Pixel Format"
.PP
Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.
.PP

.IX Item "-compression_level integer"
For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the \fImethod\fR option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.
.IP "\fB\-quality\fR \fIfloat\fR" 4

\fISpeed considerations\fR
.IX Subsection "Speed considerations"

In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.
.PP
Setting a higher \fBbits_per_mb\fR limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the \fBqscale\fR parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.

.PP
Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the
MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed \-\- and *omitted* \-\-
Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2,
and it must use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or
progressive. . . . You can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and
decode them with a regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend
the DHT segment to them, or else the decoder won't have any idea
how to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given in
the OpenDML spec."

DivX-style packed B\-frames are not valid MPEG\-4 and were only a

They use more space, can cause minor AV sync issues, require more
CPU power to decode (unless the player has some decoded picture queue
to compensate the 2,0,2,0 frame per packet style) and cause
trouble if copied into a standard container like mp4 or mpeg\-ps/ts,
because MPEG\-4 decoders may not be able to decode them, since they are
not valid MPEG\-4.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-list\-demuxers\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-demuxers\*(C'\fR, and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-demuxer=\fR\f(CIDEMUXER\fR\f(CW\*(C'\fR, or disable it
with the option \f(CW\*(C`\-\-disable\-demuxer=\fR\f(CIDEMUXER\fR\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
.PP
The option \f(CW\*(C`\-demuxers\*(C'\fR of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers. Use \f(CW\*(C`\-formats\*(C'\fR to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.
.PP
The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.
.SS aa
.IX Subsection "aa"
Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 (.aa) files.
.SS aac
.IX Subsection "aac"
Raw Audio Data Transport Stream AAC demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux an ADTS input containing a single AAC stream
alongwith any ID3v1/2 or APE tags in it.
.SS apng
.IX Subsection "apng"
Animated Portable Network Graphics demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux APNG files.
All headers, but the PNG signature, up to (but not including) the first
fcTL chunk are transmitted as extradata.
Frames are then split as being all the chunks between two fcTL ones, or
between the last fcTL and IEND chunks.
.IP "\fB\-ignore_loop\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ignore_loop bool"
Ignore the loop variable in the file if set. Default is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-max_fps\fR \fIint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-max_fps int"
Maximum framerate in frames per second. Default of 0 imposes no limit.
.IP "\fB\-default_fps\fR \fIint\fR" 4
.IX Item "-default_fps int"
Default framerate in frames per second when none is specified in the file
(0 meaning as fast as possible). Default is 15.
.SS asf
.IX Subsection "asf"
Advanced Systems Format demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer is used to demux ASF files and MMS network streams.
.IP "\fB\-no_resync_search\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no_resync_search bool"
Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.
.SS concat
.IX Subsection "concat"
Virtual concatenation script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packets had been muxed
together.
.PP
The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.
.PP
All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).
.PP
The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.
.PP
\fISyntax\fR
.IX Subsection "Syntax"
.PP
The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""file path""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBfile path\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "file path"
Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.
.Sp
All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""ffconcat version 1.0""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBffconcat version 1.0\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "ffconcat version 1.0"
Identify the script type and version.
.Sp
To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appear exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""duration dur""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBduration dur\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "duration dur"
Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.
.Sp
If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""inpoint timestamp""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBinpoint timestamp\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "inpoint timestamp"
In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file it instantly seeks to the
specified timestamp. Seeking is done so that all streams can be presented
successfully at In point.
.Sp
This directive works best with intra frame codecs, because for non-intra frame
ones you will usually get extra packets before the actual In point and the
decoded content will most likely contain frames before In point too.
.Sp
For each file, packets before the file In point will have timestamps less than
the calculated start timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
file), and the duration of the files (if not specified by the \f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR
directive) will be reduced based on their specified In point.
.Sp
Because of potential packets before the specified In point, packet timestamps
may overlap between two concatenated files.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""outpoint timestamp""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBoutpoint timestamp\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "outpoint timestamp"
Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the specified decoding
timestamp in any of the streams, it handles it as an end of file condition and
skips the current and all the remaining packets from all streams.
.Sp
Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer will not output packets
with a decoding timestamp greater or equal to Out point.
.Sp
This directive works best with intra frame codecs and formats where all streams
are tightly interleaved. For non-intra frame codecs you will usually get
additional packets with presentation timestamp after Out point therefore the
decoded content will most likely contain frames after Out point too. If your
streams are not tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets from all
streams before Out point and you may only will be able to decode the earliest
stream until Out point.
.Sp
The duration of the files (if not specified by the \f(CW\*(C`duration\*(C'\fR
directive) will be reduced based on their specified Out point.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""file_packet_metadata key=value""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBfile_packet_metadata key=value\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "file_packet_metadata key=value"
Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified metadata will be set for
each file packet. You can specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
metadata entries.
This directive is deprecated, use \f(CW\*(C`file_packet_meta\*(C'\fR instead.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""file_packet_meta key value""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBfile_packet_meta key value\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "file_packet_meta key value"
Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified metadata will be set for
each file packet. You can specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
metadata entries.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""option key value""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBoption key value\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "option key value"
Option to access, open and probe the file.
Can be present multiple times.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""stream""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP \fR\f(CBstream\fR\fB\fR 4
.IX Item "stream"
Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
stream.
Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the
matching streams in the subfiles.
If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""exact_stream_id id""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBexact_stream_id id\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "exact_stream_id id"
Set the id of the stream.
If this directive is given, the string with the corresponding id in the
subfiles will be used.
This is especially useful for MPEG-PS (VOB) files, where the order of the
streams is not reliable.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""stream_meta key value""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBstream_meta key value\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_meta key value"

.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""stream_codec value""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBstream_codec value\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_codec value"
Codec for the stream.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""stream_extradata hex_string""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBstream_extradata hex_string\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "stream_extradata hex_string"
Extradata for the string, encoded in hexadecimal.
.ie n .IP "\fR\fB""chapter id start end""\fR\fB\fR" 4
.el .IP "\fR\f(CBchapter id start end\fR\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "chapter id start end"
Add a chapter. \fIid\fR is an unique identifier, possibly small and
consecutive.

.PP
This demuxer accepts the following option:
.IP \fBsafe\fR 4
.IX Item "safe"
If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths and directives.
A file path is considered safe if it
does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components
only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits,
period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a

.SS image2
.IX Subsection "image2"
Image file demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option \fIpattern_type\fR.
.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.
.PP
The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.
.PP
This demuxer accepts the following options:
.IP \fBframerate\fR 4
.IX Item "framerate"
Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.
.IP \fBloop\fR 4
.IX Item "loop"
If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.
.IP \fBpattern_type\fR 4
.IX Item "pattern_type"
Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.
.Sp
\&\fIpattern_type\fR accepts one of the following values.
.RS 4
.IP \fBnone\fR 4
.IX Item "none"
Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will only contain the specified
image. You should use this option if you do not want to create sequences from
multiple images and your filenames may contain special pattern characters.
.IP \fBsequence\fR 4
.IX Item "sequence"
Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.
.Sp
A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0\fIN\fRd", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
"%d0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0\-padded and \fIN\fR is the total number of 0\-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string "%%".
.Sp
If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between \fIstart_number\fR and
\&\fIstart_number\fR+\fIstart_number_range\fR\-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.
.Sp
For example the pattern "img\-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g\-%d.jpg" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form \fIi%m%g\-1.jpg\fR,
\&\fIi%m%g\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIi%m%g\-10.jpg\fR, etc.
.Sp
Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to convert a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR you can employ the command:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i img.jpeg img.png
.Ve
.IP \fBglob\fR 4
.IX Item "glob"
Select a glob wildcard pattern type.
.Sp
The pattern is interpreted like a \f(CWglob()\fR pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.
.IP "\fBglob_sequence\fR \fI(deprecated, will be removed)\fR" 4
.IX Item "glob_sequence (deprecated, will be removed)"
Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.
.Sp
If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
\&\f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR that is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
interpreted like a \f(CWglob()\fR pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.
.Sp
All glob special characters \f(CW\*(C`%*?[]{}\*(C'\fR must be prefixed
with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".
.Sp
For example the pattern \f(CW\*(C`foo\-%*.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the
filenames prefixed by "foo\-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
\&\f(CW\*(C`foo\-%?%?%?.jpeg\*(C'\fR will match all the filenames prefixed with
"foo\-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with ".jpeg".

.IP \fBinterleaved_read\fR 4
.IX Item "interleaved_read"
Interleave packets from multiple tracks at demuxer level. For badly interleaved files, this prevents playback issues
caused by large gaps between packets in different tracks, as MOV/MP4 do not have packet placement requirements.
However, this can cause excessive seeking on very badly interleaved files, due to seeking between tracks, so disabling
it may prevent I/O issues, at the expense of playback.

Raw video demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them

SBaGen script demuxer.
.PP
This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen

script looks like that:
.PP

\&        +0:21:00 == b
\&        +0:30:00    off
.Ve
.PP
A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the \fINOW\fR reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.

It accepts the following options:
.IP \fBreserve_index_space\fR 4
.IX Item "reserve_index_space"
Reserve the specified amount of bytes for the OpenDML master index of each
stream within the file header. By default additional master indexes are
embedded within the data packets if there is no space left in the first master
index and are linked together as a chain of indexes. This index structure can
cause problems for some use cases, e.g. third-party software strictly relying
on the OpenDML index specification or when file seeking is slow. Reserving
enough index space in the file header avoids these problems.

.IX Item "adaptation_sets adaptation_sets"
Assign streams to AdaptationSets. Syntax is "id=x,streams=a,b,c id=y,streams=d,e" with x and y being the IDs
of the adaptation sets and a,b,c,d and e are the indices of the mapped streams.
.Sp
To map all video (or audio) streams to an AdaptationSet, "v" (or "a") can be used as stream identifier instead of IDs.
.Sp
When no assignment is defined, this defaults to an AdaptationSet for each stream.
.Sp
Optional syntax is "id=x,seg_duration=x,frag_duration=x,frag_type=type,descriptor=descriptor_string,streams=a,b,c id=y,seg_duration=y,frag_type=type,streams=d,e" and so on,
descriptor is useful to the scheme defined by ISO/IEC 23009\-1:2014/Amd.2:2015.
For example, \-adaptation_sets "id=0,descriptor=<SupplementalProperty schemeIdUri=\e"urn:mpeg:dash:srd:2014\e" value=\e"0,0,0,1,1,2,2\e"/>,streams=v".
Please note that descriptor string should be a self-closing xml tag.
seg_duration, frag_duration and frag_type override the global option values for each adaptation set.
For example, \-adaptation_sets "id=0,seg_duration=2,frag_duration=1,frag_type=duration,streams=v id=1,seg_duration=2,frag_type=none,streams=a"
type_id marks an adaptation set as containing streams meant to be used for Trick Mode for the referenced adaptation set.
For example, \-adaptation_sets "id=0,seg_duration=2,frag_type=none,streams=0 id=1,seg_duration=10,frag_type=none,trick_id=0,streams=1"

.Sp
When enabled, the logic monitors the flow of segment indexes. If a streams's
segment index value is not at the expected real time position, then the logic
corrects that index value.

Typically this logic is needed in live streaming use cases. The network bandwidth
fluctuations are common during long run streaming. Each fluctuation can cause
the segment indexes fall behind the expected real time position.

The fifo pseudo-muxer allows the separation of encoding and muxing by using
first-in-first-out queue and running the actual muxer in a separate thread. This
is especially useful in combination with the \fBtee\fR muxer and can be used to
send data to several destinations with different reliability/writing speed/latency.
.PP
API users should be aware that callback functions (interrupt_callback,
io_open and io_close) used within its AVFormatContext must be thread-safe.
.PP
The behavior of the fifo muxer if the queue fills up or if the output fails is
selectable,
.IP \(bu 4
output can be transparently restarted with configurable delay between retries

If set to 1 (true), in case the fifo queue fills up, packets will be dropped
rather than blocking the encoder. This makes it possible to continue streaming without
delaying the input, at the cost of omitting part of the stream. By default
this option is set to 0 (false), so in such cases the encoder will be blocked
until the muxer processes some of the packets and none of them is lost.

see \fBthe Time duration section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR.
.Sp
Segment will be cut on the next key frame after this time has passed on the first m3u8 list.
After the initial playlist is filled \fBffmpeg\fR will cut segments
at duration equal to \f(CW\*(C`hls_time\*(C'\fR
.IP "\fBhls_time\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_time duration"
Set the target segment length. Default value is 2.
.Sp
\&\fIduration\fR must be a time duration specification,
see \fBthe Time duration section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR.
Segment will be cut on the next key frame after this time has passed.
.IP "\fBhls_list_size\fR \fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_list_size size"
Set the maximum number of playlist entries. If set to 0 the list file
will contain all the segments. Default value is 5.
.IP "\fBhls_delete_threshold\fR \fIsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_delete_threshold size"
Set the number of unreferenced segments to keep on disk before \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags delete_segments\*(C'\fR
deletes them. Increase this to allow continue clients to download segments which
were recently referenced in the playlist. Default value is 1, meaning segments older than
\&\f(CW\*(C`hls_list_size+1\*(C'\fR will be deleted.
.IP \fBhls_start_number_source\fR 4
.IX Item "hls_start_number_source"
Start the playlist sequence number (\f(CW\*(C`#EXT\-X\-MEDIA\-SEQUENCE\*(C'\fR) according to the specified source.
Unless \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags single_file\*(C'\fR is set, it also specifies source of starting sequence numbers of
segment and subtitle filenames. In any case, if \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags append_list\*(C'\fR
is set and read playlist sequence number is greater than the specified start sequence number,
then that value will be used as start value.
.Sp
It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBgeneric (default)\fR" 4
.IX Item "generic (default)"
Set the starting sequence numbers according to \fIstart_number\fR option value.
.IP \fBepoch\fR 4

Start the playlist sequence number (\f(CW\*(C`#EXT\-X\-MEDIA\-SEQUENCE\*(C'\fR) from the specified \fInumber\fR
when \fIhls_start_number_source\fR value is \fIgeneric\fR. (This is the default case.)
Unless \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags single_file\*(C'\fR is set, it also specifies starting sequence numbers of segment and subtitle filenames.
Default value is 0.
.IP "\fBhls_allow_cache\fR \fIallowcache\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_allow_cache allowcache"
Explicitly set whether the client MAY (1) or MUST NOT (0) cache media segments.
.IP "\fBhls_base_url\fR \fIbaseurl\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_base_url baseurl"
Append \fIbaseurl\fR to every entry in the playlist.
Useful to generate playlists with absolute paths.
.Sp
Note that the playlist sequence number must be unique for each segment
and it is not to be confused with the segment filename sequence number
which can be cyclic, for example if the \fBwrap\fR option is
specified.
.IP "\fBhls_segment_filename\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "hls_segment_filename filename"
Set the segment filename. Unless \f(CW\*(C`hls_flags single_file\*(C'\fR is set,
\&\fIfilename\fR is used as a string format with the segment number:
.Sp
.Vb 1

This example will produce the playlist, \fIout.m3u8\fR, and segment files:
\&\fIfile000.ts\fR, \fIfile001.ts\fR, \fIfile002.ts\fR, etc.
.Sp
\&\fIfilename\fR may contain full path or relative path specification,
but only the file name part without any path info will be contained in the m3u8 segment list.
Should a relative path be specified, the path of the created segment
files will be relative to the current working directory.
When strftime_mkdir is set, the whole expanded value of \fIfilename\fR will be written into the m3u8 segment list.
.Sp
When \f(CW\*(C`var_stream_map\*(C'\fR is set with two or more variant streams, the
\&\fIfilename\fR pattern must contain the string "%v", this string specifies
the position of variant stream index in the generated segment file names.

.IX Item "hls_key_info_file key_info_file"
Use the information in \fIkey_info_file\fR for segment encryption. The first
line of \fIkey_info_file\fR specifies the key URI written to the playlist. The
key URL is used to access the encryption key during playback. The second line
specifies the path to the key file used to obtain the key during the encryption
process. The key file is read as a single packed array of 16 octets in binary
format. The optional third line specifies the initialization vector (IV) as a
hexadecimal string to be used instead of the segment sequence number (default)
for encryption. Changes to \fIkey_info_file\fR will result in segment
encryption with the new key/IV and an entry in the playlist for the new key

.IX Subsection "image2"
Image file muxer.
.PP
The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.
.PP
The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0\fIN\fRd", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form "%0\fIN\fRd" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0\-padded to \fIN\fR
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string "%%".
.PP
If the pattern contains "%d" or "%0\fIN\fRd", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.
.PP
The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.
.PP
For example the pattern "img\-%03d.bmp" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form \fIimg\-001.bmp\fR, \fIimg\-002.bmp\fR, ...,
\&\fIimg\-010.bmp\fR, etc.
The pattern "img%%\-%d.jpg" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form \fIimg%\-1.jpg\fR, \fIimg%\-2.jpg\fR, ..., \fIimg%\-10.jpg\fR,
etc.
.PP
The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for
each of the YUV420P components. To read or write this image file format,
specify the name of the '.Y' file. The muxer will automatically open the
\&'.U' and '.V' files as required.

The following example shows how to use \fBffmpeg\fR for creating a
sequence of files \fIimg\-001.jpeg\fR, \fIimg\-002.jpeg\fR, ...,
taking one image every second from the input video:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vsync cfr \-r 1 \-f image2 \*(Aqimg\-%03d.jpeg\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note that with \fBffmpeg\fR, if the format is not specified with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-vsync cfr \-r 1 \*(Aqimg\-%03d.jpeg\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0\fIN\fRd", for example to create a single image file
\&\fIimg.jpeg\fR from the start of the input video you can employ the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i in.avi \-f image2 \-frames:v 1 img.jpeg
.Ve
.PP
The \fBstrftime\fR option allows you to expand the filename with
date and time information. Check the documentation of
the \f(CWstrftime()\fR function for the syntax.
.PP
For example to generate image files from the \f(CWstrftime()\fR
"%Y\-%m\-%d_%H\-%M\-%S" pattern, the following \fBffmpeg\fR command
can be used:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f v4l2 \-r 1 \-i /dev/video0 \-f image2 \-strftime 1 "%Y\-%m\-%d_%H\-%M\-%S.jpg"
.Ve
.PP
You can set the file name with current frame's PTS:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f v4l2 \-r 1 \-i /dev/video0 \-copyts \-f image2 \-frame_pts true %d.jpg

This muxer supports the following options:
.IP \fBreserve_index_space\fR 4
.IX Item "reserve_index_space"
By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
\&\-\- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow \-\- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.
.Sp
If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the reserved space does not suffice, no Cues will be written, the
file will be finalized and writing the trailer will return an error.
A safe size for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.
.Sp
Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will
have no effect if it is not.
.IP \fBcues_to_front\fR 4
.IX Item "cues_to_front"
If set, the muxer will write the index at the beginning of the file
by shifting the main data if necessary. This can be combined with
reserve_index_space in which case the data is only shifted if
the initially reserved space turns out to be insufficient.
.Sp
This option is ignored if the output is unseekable.
.IP \fBdefault_mode\fR 4

Every track with disposition default will have the FlagDefault set.
Additionally, for each type of track (audio, video or subtitle), if no track
with disposition default of this type exists, then the first track of this type
will be marked as default (if existing). This ensures that the default flag
is set in a sensible way even if the input originated from containers that
lack the concept of default tracks.
.IP \fBinfer_no_subs\fR 4

.IX Subsection "mov, mp4, ismv"
MOV/MP4/ISMV (Smooth Streaming) muxer.
.PP
The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a MOV/MP4
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding \f(CW\*(C`+faststart\*(C'\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`\-movflags\*(C'\fR, or
using the \fBqt-faststart\fR tool).
.PP
A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal MOV/MP4 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal MOV/MP4 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.
.PP
Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the options that define
how to cut the file into fragments: \f(CW\*(C`\-frag_duration\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-frag_size\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-min_frag_duration\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-movflags +frag_keyframe\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-movflags +frag_custom\*(C'\fR. If more than one condition is specified,
fragments are cut when one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The

.IP "\fBmovflags\fR \fIflags\fR" 4
.IX Item "movflags flags"
Set various muxing switches. The following flags can be used:
.RS 4
.IP \fBfrag_keyframe\fR 4
.IX Item "frag_keyframe"
Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.
.IP \fBfrag_custom\fR 4
.IX Item "frag_custom"
Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
calling \f(CW\*(C`av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)\*(C'\fR to write a fragment with
the packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
applications integrating libavformat, not from \fBffmpeg\fR.)
.IP \fBempty_moov\fR 4
.IX Item "empty_moov"
Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal MOV/MP4 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP \fBseparate_moof\fR 4
.IX Item "separate_moof"
Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.
.IP \fBskip_sidx\fR 4
.IX Item "skip_sidx"
Skip writing of sidx atom. When bitrate overhead due to sidx atom is high,
this option could be used for cases where sidx atom is not mandatory.
When global_sidx flag is enabled, this option will be ignored.
.IP \fBfaststart\fR 4
.IX Item "faststart"
Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such
as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.
.IP \fBrtphint\fR 4
.IX Item "rtphint"
Add RTP hinting tracks to the output file.
.IP \fBdisable_chpl\fR 4
.IX Item "disable_chpl"
Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.
.IP \fBomit_tfhd_offset\fR 4
.IX Item "omit_tfhd_offset"
Do not write any absolute base_data_offset in tfhd atoms. This avoids
tying fragments to absolute byte positions in the file/streams.
.IP \fBdefault_base_moof\fR 4
.IX Item "default_base_moof"
Similarly to the omit_tfhd_offset, this flag avoids writing the
absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using
the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from
14496\-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain
circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations
on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).
.IP \fBnegative_cts_offsets\fR 4
.IX Item "negative_cts_offsets"
Enables utilization of version 1 of the CTTS box, in which the CTS offsets can
be negative. This enables the initial sample to have DTS/CTS of zero, and
reduces the need for edit lists for some cases such as video tracks with
B\-frames. Additionally, eases conformance with the DASH-IF interoperability
guidelines.
.Sp
This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead of placing the
moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is insufficient, muxing will fail.
.IP \fBwrite_tmcd\fR 4
.IX Item "write_tmcd"
Specify \f(CW\*(C`on\*(C'\fR to force writing a timecode track, \f(CW\*(C`off\*(C'\fR to disable it
and \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR to write a timecode track only for mov and mp4 output (default).
.IP "\fBwrite_btrt\fR \fIbool\fR" 4
.IX Item "write_btrt bool"
Force or disable writing bitrate box inside stsd box of a track.
The box contains decoding buffer size (in bytes), maximum bitrate and
average bitrate for the track. The box will be skipped if none of these values
can be computed.
Default is \f(CW\-1\fR or \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR, which will write the box only in MP4 mode.
.IP \fBwrite_prft\fR 4
.IX Item "write_prft"
Write producer time reference box (PRFT) with a specified time source for the
NTP field in the PRFT box. Set value as \fBwallclock\fR to specify timesource
as wallclock time and \fBpts\fR to specify timesource as input packets' PTS
values.
.Sp
Setting value to \fBpts\fR is applicable only for a live encoding use case,
where PTS values are set as as wallclock time at the source. For example, an
encoding use case with decklink capture source where \fBvideo_pts\fR and
\&\fBaudio_pts\fR are set to \fBabs_wallclock\fR.

.SS mp3
.IX Subsection "mp3"
The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with the following optional features:
.IP \(bu 4
An ID3v2 metadata header at the beginning (enabled by default). Versions 2.3 and
2.4 are supported, the \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR private option controls which one is
used (3 or 4). Setting \f(CW\*(C`id3v2_version\*(C'\fR to 0 disables the ID3v2 header
completely.
.Sp
The muxer supports writing attached pictures (APIC frames) to the ID3v2 header.
The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single
packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a
single APIC frame.  The stream metadata tags \fItitle\fR and \fIcomment\fR map
to APIC \fIdescription\fR and \fIpicture type\fR respectively. See
<\fBhttp://id3.org/id3v2.4.0\-frames\fR> for allowed picture types.
.Sp
Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.
.IP \(bu 4
A Xing/LAME frame right after the ID3v2 header (if present). It is enabled by
default, but will be written only if the output is seekable. The
\&\f(CW\*(C`write_xing\*(C'\fR private option can be used to disable it.  The frame contains
various information that may be useful to the decoder, like the audio duration
or encoder delay.
.IP \(bu 4
A legacy ID3v1 tag at the end of the file (disabled by default). It may be
enabled with the \f(CW\*(C`write_id3v1\*(C'\fR private option, but as its capabilities are
very limited, its usage is not recommended.
.PP

.PP
Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:

Basic stream segmenter.
.PP
This muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of nearly
fixed duration. Output filename pattern can be set in a fashion
similar to \fBimage2\fR, or by using a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR template if
the \fBstrftime\fR option is enabled.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`stream_segment\*(C'\fR is a variant of the muxer used to write to
streaming output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers,
and is recommended for outputting e.g. to MPEG transport stream segments.
\&\f(CW\*(C`ssegment\*(C'\fR is a shorter alias for \f(CW\*(C`stream_segment\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Every segment starts with a keyframe of the selected reference stream,
which is set through the \fBreference_stream\fR option.
.PP
Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
time.
.PP
The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.
.PP
Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
the option \fIsegment_list\fR. The list type is specified by the
\&\fIsegment_list_type\fR option. The entry filenames in the segment
list are set by default to the basename of the corresponding segment
files.
.PP
See also the \fBhls\fR muxer, which provides a more specific
implementation for HLS segmentation.
.PP

The segment muxer supports the following options:
.IP "\fBincrement_tc\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "increment_tc 1|0"
if set to \f(CW1\fR, increment timecode between each segment
If this is selected, the input need to have

\&\f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBreference_stream\fR \fIspecifier\fR" 4
.IX Item "reference_stream specifier"
Set the reference stream, as specified by the string \fIspecifier\fR.
If \fIspecifier\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR, the reference is chosen
automatically. Otherwise it must be a stream specifier (see the ``Stream

.RE
.IP "\fBsegment_time\fR \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_time time"
Set segment duration to \fItime\fR, the value must be a duration
specification. Default value is "2". See also the
\&\fBsegment_times\fR option.
.Sp
Note that splitting may not be accurate, unless you force the
reference stream key-frames at the given time. See the introductory
notice and the examples below.
.IP "\fBmin_seg_duration\fR \fItime\fR" 4
.IX Item "min_seg_duration time"
Set minimum segment duration to \fItime\fR, the value must be a duration
specification. This prevents the muxer ending segments at a duration below
this value. Only effective with \f(CW\*(C`segment_time\*(C'\fR. Default value is "0".
.IP "\fBsegment_atclocktime\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_atclocktime 1|0"
If set to "1" split at regular clock time intervals starting from 00:00
o'clock. The \fItime\fR value specified in \fBsegment_time\fR is
used for setting the length of the splitting interval.
.Sp
For example with \fBsegment_time\fR set to "900" this makes it possible
to create files at 12:00 o'clock, 12:15, 12:30, etc.
.Sp
Default value is "0".
.IP "\fBsegment_clocktime_offset\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_clocktime_offset duration"
Delay the segment splitting times with the specified duration when using
\&\fBsegment_atclocktime\fR.
.Sp
For example with \fBsegment_time\fR set to "900" and
\&\fBsegment_clocktime_offset\fR set to "300" this makes it possible to
create files at 12:05, 12:20, 12:35, etc.
.Sp
Default value is "0".
.IP "\fBsegment_clocktime_wrap_duration\fR \fIduration\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_clocktime_wrap_duration duration"
Force the segmenter to only start a new segment if a packet reaches the muxer
within the specified duration after the segmenting clock time. This way you
can make the segmenter more resilient to backward local time jumps, such as
leap seconds or transition to standard time from daylight savings time.
.Sp
Default is the maximum possible duration which means starting a new segment
regardless of the elapsed time since the last clock time.
.IP "\fBsegment_time_delta\fR \fIdelta\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_time_delta delta"
Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
segment, expressed as a duration specification. Default value is "0".
.Sp
When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
PTS satisfies the relation:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        PTS >= start_time \- time_delta
.Ve
.Sp
This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
split at GOP boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before the
specified split time.
.Sp
In particular may be used in combination with the \fIffmpeg\fR option
\&\fIforce_key_frames\fR. The key frame times specified by
\&\fIforce_key_frames\fR may not be set accurately because of rounding
issues, with the consequence that a key frame time may result set just
before the specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
1/(2*\fIframe_rate\fR) should address the worst case mismatch between
the specified time and the time set by \fIforce_key_frames\fR.
.IP "\fBsegment_times\fR \fItimes\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_times times"
Specify a list of split points. \fItimes\fR contains a list of comma
separated duration specifications, in increasing order. See also
the \fBsegment_time\fR option.
.IP "\fBsegment_frames\fR \fIframes\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_frames frames"
Specify a list of split video frame numbers. \fIframes\fR contains a
list of comma separated integer numbers, in increasing order.
.Sp
This option specifies to start a new segment whenever a reference
stream key frame is found and the sequential number (starting from 0)
of the frame is greater or equal to the next value in the list.
.IP "\fBsegment_wrap\fR \fIlimit\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_wrap limit"
Wrap around segment index once it reaches \fIlimit\fR.
.IP "\fBsegment_start_number\fR \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "segment_start_number number"
Set the sequence number of the first segment. Defaults to \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBstrftime\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "strftime 1|0"
Use the \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR function to define the name of the new
segments to write. If this is selected, the output segment name must
contain a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR function template. Default value is
\&\f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBbreak_non_keyframes\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "break_non_keyframes 1|0"
If enabled, allow segments to start on frames other than keyframes. This
improves behavior on some players when the time between keyframes is
inconsistent, but may make things worse on others, and can cause some oddities
during seeking. Defaults to \f(CW0\fR.
.IP "\fBreset_timestamps\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "reset_timestamps 1|0"
Reset timestamps at the beginning of each segment, so that each segment
will start with near-zero timestamps. It is meant to ease the playback
of the generated segments. May not work with some combinations of
muxers/codecs. It is set to \f(CW0\fR by default.
.IP "\fBinitial_offset\fR \fIoffset\fR" 4
.IX Item "initial_offset offset"
Specify timestamp offset to apply to the output packet timestamps. The
argument must be a time duration specification, and defaults to 0.
.IP "\fBwrite_empty_segments\fR \fI1|0\fR" 4
.IX Item "write_empty_segments 1|0"
If enabled, write an empty segment if there are no packets during the period a
segment would usually span. Otherwise, the segment will be filled with the next
packet written. Defaults to \f(CW0\fR.

.IX Subsection "streamhash"
Per stream hash testing format.
.PP
This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input frames,
on a per-stream basis. This can be used for equality checks without having
to do a complete binary comparison.
.PP
By default audio frames are converted to signed 16\-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. Timestamps
are ignored. It uses the SHA\-256 cryptographic hash function by default,
but supports several other algorithms.
.PP
The output of the muxer consists of one line per stream of the form:
\&\fIstreamindex\fR,\fIstreamtype\fR,\fIalgo\fR=\fIhash\fR, where
\&\fIstreamindex\fR is the index of the mapped stream, \fIstreamtype\fR is a

.SS tee
.IX Subsection "tee"
The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several outputs, such as files or streams.
It can be used, for example, to stream a video over a network and save it to disk at the same time.
.PP
It is different from specifying several outputs to the \fBffmpeg\fR
command-line tool. With the tee muxer, the audio and video data will be encoded only once.
With conventional multiple outputs, multiple encoding operations in parallel are initiated,
which can be a very expensive process. The tee muxer is not useful when using the libavformat API
directly because it is then possible to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.
.PP
Since the tee muxer does not represent any particular output format, ffmpeg cannot auto-select
output streams. So all streams intended for output must be specified using \f(CW\*(C`\-map\*(C'\fR. See
the examples below.
.PP
Some encoders may need different options depending on the output format;
the auto-detection of this can not work with the tee muxer, so they need to be explicitly specified.
The main example is the \fBglobal_header\fR flag.
.PP
The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, those must be
escaped (see \fBthe "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR).
.PP

.IP \fBfifo_options\fR 4
.IX Item "fifo_options"
Options to pass to fifo pseudo-muxer instances. See \fBfifo\fR.
.PP
Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
\&\fIkey\fR=\fIvalue\fR pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.
.PP
The following special options are also recognized:
.IP \fBf\fR 4
.IX Item "f"
Specify the format name. Required if it cannot be guessed from the
output URL.
.IP \fBbsfs[/\fR\fIspec\fR\fB]\fR 4
.IX Item "bsfs[/spec]"
Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.
.Sp
It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
\&\f(CW\*(C`/\*(C'\fR. \fIspec\fR must be a stream specifier (see \fBFormat
stream specifiers\fR).
.Sp
If the stream specifier is not specified, the bitstream filters will be
applied to all streams in the output. This will cause that output operation
to fail if the output contains streams to which the bitstream filter cannot
be applied e.g. \f(CW\*(C`h264_mp4toannexb\*(C'\fR being applied to an output containing an audio stream.
.Sp
Options for a bitstream filter must be specified in the form of \f(CW\*(C`opt=value\*(C'\fR.

Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by ",".

.SH METADATA
.IX Header "METADATA"
FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF\-8\-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.
.PP
The file format is as follows:
.IP 1. 4
A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.
.IP 2. 4
The header is a \fB;FFMETADATA\fR string, followed by a version number (now 1).
.IP 3. 4
Metadata tags are of the form \fBkey=value\fR
.IP 4. 4
Immediately after header follows global metadata
.IP 5. 4
After global metadata there may be sections with per\-stream/per\-chapter
metadata.
.IP 6. 4
A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. STREAM or CHAPTER) in
brackets (\fB[\fR, \fB]\fR) and ends with next section or end of file.
.IP 7. 4
At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form
\&\fBTIMEBASE=\fR\fInum\fR\fB/\fR\fIden\fR, where \fInum\fR and \fIden\fR are
integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in nanoseconds.
.Sp
Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
\&\fBSTART=\fR\fInum\fR, \fBEND=\fR\fInum\fR, where \fInum\fR is a positive
integer.
.IP 8. 4
Empty lines and lines starting with \fB;\fR or \fB#\fR are ignored.
.IP 9. 4
Metadata keys or values containing special characters (\fB=\fR, \fB;\fR,
\&\fB#\fR, \fB\e\fR and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash \fB\e\fR.
.IP 10. 4
Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. \fBfoo = bar\fR) is considered to be
a part of the tag (in the example above key is \fBfoo\fR , value is
 \fBbar\fR).
.PP
A ffmetadata file might look like this:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        ;FFMETADATA1
\&        title=bike\e\eshed
\&        ;this is a comment
\&        artist=FFmpeg troll team
\&        
\&        [CHAPTER]
\&        TIMEBASE=1/1000
\&        START=0
\&        #chapter ends at 0:01:00
\&        END=60000
\&        title=chapter \e#1
\&        [STREAM]
\&        title=multi\e
\&        line
.Ve
.PP
By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to extract
metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and then transcode
the file into an output file with the edited ffmetadata file.
.PP
Extracting an ffmetadata file with \fIffmpeg\fR goes as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE
.Ve
.PP
Reinserting edited metadata information from the FFMETADATAFILE file can
be done as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-i FFMETADATAFILE \-map_metadata 1 \-codec copy OUTPUT
.Ve
.SH "PROTOCOL OPTIONS"
.IX Header "PROTOCOL OPTIONS"
The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the protocols. In addition each protocol may support
so-called private options, which are specific for that component.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVFormatContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR API
for programmatic use.
.PP
The list of supported options follows:
.IP "\fBprotocol_whitelist\fR \fIlist\fR \fB(\fR\fIinput\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "protocol_whitelist list (input)"
Set a ","\-separated list of allowed protocols. "ALL" matches all protocols. Protocols
prefixed by "\-" are disabled.
All protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an another
protocol (nested protocols) are restricted to a per protocol subset.
.SH PROTOCOLS
.IX Header "PROTOCOLS"
Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access to
resources that require specific protocols.
.PP
When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "\-\-list\-protocols".
.PP
You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
"\-\-disable\-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "\-\-enable\-protocol=\fIPROTOCOL\fR", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
"\-\-disable\-protocol=\fIPROTOCOL\fR".
.PP
The option "\-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.
.PP
All protocols accept the following options:
.IP \fBrw_timeout\fR 4
.IX Item "rw_timeout"
Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to complete,
in microseconds.
.PP
A description of the currently available protocols follows.
.SS amqp
.IX Subsection "amqp"
Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP) version 0\-9\-1 is a broker based
publish-subscribe communication protocol.
.PP
FFmpeg must be compiled with \-\-enable\-librabbitmq to support AMQP. A separate
AMQP broker must also be run. An example open-source AMQP broker is RabbitMQ.
.PP
After starting the broker, an FFmpeg client may stream data to the broker using
the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-re \-i input \-f mpegts amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]
.Ve
.PP
Where hostname and port (default is 5672) is the address of the broker. The
client may also set a user/password for authentication. The default for both
fields is "guest". Name of virtual host on broker can be set with vhost. The
default value is "/".
.PP
Muliple subscribers may stream from the broker using the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay amqp://[[user]:[password]@]hostname[:port][/vhost]
.Ve
.PP
In RabbitMQ all data published to the broker flows through a specific exchange,
and each subscribing client has an assigned queue/buffer. When a packet arrives
at an exchange, it may be copied to a client's queue depending on the exchange
and routing_key fields.
.PP
The following options are supported:
.IP \fBexchange\fR 4
.IX Item "exchange"
Sets the exchange to use on the broker. RabbitMQ has several predefined
exchanges: "amq.direct" is the default exchange, where the publisher and
subscriber must have a matching routing_key; "amq.fanout" is the same as a
broadcast operation (i.e. the data is forwarded to all queues on the fanout
exchange independent of the routing_key); and "amq.topic" is similar to
"amq.direct", but allows for more complex pattern matching (refer to the RabbitMQ
documentation).
.IP \fBrouting_key\fR 4
.IX Item "routing_key"
Sets the routing key. The default value is "amqp". The routing key is used on
the "amq.direct" and "amq.topic" exchanges to decide whether packets are written
to the queue of a subscriber.
.IP \fBpkt_size\fR 4
.IX Item "pkt_size"
Maximum size of each packet sent/received to the broker. Default is 131072.
Minimum is 4096 and max is any large value (representable by an int). When
receiving packets, this sets an internal buffer size in FFmpeg. It should be
equal to or greater than the size of the published packets to the broker. Otherwise
the received message may be truncated causing decoding errors.
.IP \fBconnection_timeout\fR 4
.IX Item "connection_timeout"
The timeout in seconds during the initial connection to the broker. The
default value is rw_timeout, or 5 seconds if rw_timeout is not set.
.IP "\fBdelivery_mode\fR \fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "delivery_mode mode"
Sets the delivery mode of each message sent to broker.
The following values are accepted:
.RS 4
.IP \fBpersistent\fR 4
.IX Item "persistent"
Delivery mode set to "persistent" (2). This is the default value.
Messages may be written to the broker's disk depending on its setup.
.IP \fBnon-persistent\fR 4
.IX Item "non-persistent"
Delivery mode set to "non-persistent" (1).
Messages will stay in broker's memory unless the broker is under memory
pressure.

.Ve
.PP
where \fIURL1\fR, \fIURL2\fR, ..., \fIURLN\fR are the urls of the

.PP
The accepted syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        fd: \-fd <file_descriptor>
.Ve
.PP
If \fBfd\fR is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be
used for writing, stdin for reading. Unlike the pipe protocol, fd protocol has
seek support if it corresponding to a regular file. fd protocol doesn't support
pass file descriptor via URL for security.
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP \fBblocksize\fR 4
.IX Item "blocksize"
Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
\&\f(CW\*(C`INT_MAX\*(C'\fR, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.
.IP \fBfd\fR 4
.IX Item "fd"
Set file descriptor.
.SS file
.IX Subsection "file"
File access protocol.
.PP
Read from or write to a file.
.PP
A file URL can have the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        file:<filename>
.Ve
.PP
where \fIfilename\fR is the path of the file to read.
.PP
An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a
file URL. Depending on the build, an URL that looks like a Windows
path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be
a file URL (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).
.PP
For example to read from a file \fIinput.mpeg\fR with \fBffmpeg\fR
use the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg
.Ve
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP \fBtruncate\fR 4
.IX Item "truncate"
Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents
truncating. Default value is 1.
.IP \fBblocksize\fR 4
.IX Item "blocksize"
Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
\&\f(CW\*(C`INT_MAX\*(C'\fR, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.
.IP \fBfollow\fR 4
.IX Item "follow"
If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end of the file, allowing
reading files that still are being written. In order for this to terminate,
you either need to use the rw_timeout option, or use the interrupt callback
(for API users).
.IP \fBseekable\fR 4
.IX Item "seekable"
Controls if seekability is advertised on the file. 0 means non-seekable, \-1
means auto (seekable for normal files, non-seekable for named pipes).
.Sp
Many demuxers handle seekable and non-seekable resources differently,
overriding this might speed up opening certain files at the cost of losing some
features (e.g. accurate seeking).
.SS ftp
.IX Subsection "ftp"
FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
.PP
Read from or write to remote resources using FTP protocol.
.PP
Following syntax is required.
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options.
.IP \fBtimeout\fR 4
.IX Item "timeout"
Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to \-1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.
.IP \fBftp-user\fR 4
.IX Item "ftp-user"
Set a user to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by the
user in the FTP URL.
.IP \fBftp-password\fR 4
.IX Item "ftp-password"
Set a password to be used for authenticating to the FTP server. This is overridden by
the password in the FTP URL, or by \fBftp-anonymous-password\fR if no user is set.
.IP \fBftp-anonymous-password\fR 4
.IX Item "ftp-anonymous-password"
Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e\-mail address
should be used.
.IP \fBftp-write-seekable\fR 4
.IX Item "ftp-write-seekable"
Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set to 1 the
resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not
to be seekable. Default value is 0.
.PP
NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do
it, unless special care is taken (tests, customized server configuration
etc.). Different FTP servers behave in different way during seek
operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.

The Gopher protocol with TLS encapsulation.
.SS hls
.IX Subsection "hls"
Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+\fIproto\fR" after the hls URI scheme name, where \fIproto\fR

.SS http
.IX Subsection "http"
HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP \fBseekable\fR 4
.IX Item "seekable"
Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the resource is
supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable,
if set to \-1 it will try to autodetect if it is seekable. Default
value is \-1.

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the protocol will use a
string describing the libavformat build. ("Lavf/<version>")
.IP \fBreconnect_at_eof\fR 4
.IX Item "reconnect_at_eof"
If set then eof is treated like an error and causes reconnection, this is useful
for live / endless streams.

.IX Item "icy_metadata_headers"
If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the ICY-specific HTTP reply
headers, separated by newline characters.
.IP \fBicy_metadata_packet\fR 4
.IX Item "icy_metadata_packet"
If the server supports ICY metadata, and \fBicy\fR was set to 1, this
contains the last non-empty metadata packet sent by the server. It should be
polled in regular intervals by applications interested in mid-stream metadata
updates.
.IP \fBcookies\fR 4
.IX Item "cookies"
Set the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format of each cookie is the
same as the value of a Set-Cookie HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be

.IX Item "method"
When used as a client option it sets the HTTP method for the request.
.Sp
When used as a server option it sets the HTTP method that is going to be
expected from the client(s).
If the expected and the received HTTP method do not match the client will
be given a Bad Request response.
When unset the HTTP method is not checked for now. This will be replaced by
autodetection in the future.
.IP \fBlisten\fR 4
.IX Item "listen"
If set to 1 enables experimental HTTP server. This can be used to send data when
used as an output option, or read data from a client with HTTP POST when used as
an input option.
If set to 2 enables experimental multi-client HTTP server. This is not yet implemented
in ffmpeg.c and thus must not be used as a command line option.

.IX Item "send_expect_100"
Send an Expect: 100\-continue header for POST. If set to 1 it will send, if set
to 0 it won't, if set to \-1 it will try to send if it is applicable. Default
value is \-1.
.IP \fBauth_type\fR 4
.IX Item "auth_type"
Set HTTP authentication type. No option for Digest, since this method requires
getting nonce parameters from the server first and can't be used straight away like
Basic.
.RS 4
.IP \fBnone\fR 4
.IX Item "none"
Choose the HTTP authentication type automatically. This is the default.
.IP \fBbasic\fR 4
.IX Item "basic"
Choose the HTTP basic authentication.
.Sp
Basic authentication sends a Base64\-encoded string that contains a user name and password
for the client. Base64 is not a form of encryption and should be considered the same as
sending the user name and password in clear text (Base64 is a reversible encoding).
If a resource needs to be protected, strongly consider using an authentication scheme
other than basic authentication. HTTPS/TLS should be used with basic authentication.
Without these additional security enhancements, basic authentication should not be used
to protect sensitive or valuable information.

the very least, each cookie must specify a value along with a path and domain.
HTTP requests that match both the domain and path will automatically include the
cookie value in the HTTP Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited
by a newline.

.SS ipfs
.IX Subsection "ipfs"
InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol support. One can access files stored
on the IPFS network through so-called gateways. These are http(s) endpoints.
This protocol wraps the IPFS native protocols (ipfs:// and ipns://) to be sent
to such a gateway. Users can (and should) host their own node which means this
protocol will use one's local gateway to access files on the IPFS network.
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP \fBgateway\fR 4
.IX Item "gateway"
Defines the gateway to use. When not set, the protocol will first try
locating the local gateway by looking at \f(CW$IPFS_GATEWAY\fR, \f(CW$IPFS_PATH\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`$HOME/.ipfs/\*(C'\fR, in that order.
.PP
One can use this protocol in 2 ways. Using IPFS:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay ipfs://<hash>

MD5 output protocol.
.PP
Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can
be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.
.PP
Some examples follow.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
\&        ffmpeg \-i input.flv \-f avi \-y md5:output.avi.md5

.PP
Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.
.SS pipe
.IX Subsection "pipe"
UNIX pipe access protocol.
.PP
Read and write from UNIX pipes.
.PP
The accepted syntax is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pipe:[<number>]
.Ve
.PP
If \fBfd\fR isn't specified, \fInumber\fR is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the
pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If \fInumber\fR
is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used
for writing, stdin for reading.
.PP
For example to read from stdin with \fBffmpeg\fR:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        cat test.wav | ffmpeg \-i pipe:0
\&        # ...this is the same as...
\&        cat test.wav | ffmpeg \-i pipe:

\&        # ...this is the same as...
\&        ffmpeg \-i test.wav \-f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi
.Ve
.PP
This protocol accepts the following options:
.IP \fBblocksize\fR 4
.IX Item "blocksize"
Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
\&\f(CW\*(C`INT_MAX\*(C'\fR, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.
.IP \fBfd\fR 4

Real-Time Streaming Protocol.
.PP
RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a demuxer
and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred
over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with
data transferred over RDT).
.PP
The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's
<\fBhttps://github.com/revmischa/rtsp\-server\fR>).

along with the main media stream:
\&\fBinputbw\fR * (100 + \fBoheadbw\fR) / 100
if \fBinputbw\fR is not set while \fBmaxbw\fR is set to

this is the only flag to set the latency, however
this is effectively equivalent to setting \fBpeerlatency\fR,

Default value is caller.
.IP \fBmss=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "mss=bytes"
Maximum Segment Size, in bytes. Used for buffer allocation
and rate calculation using a packet counter assuming fully
filled packets. The smallest MSS between the peers is
used. This is 1500 by default in the overall internet.
This is the maximum size of the UDP packet and can be

.IP \fBpayload_size=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "payload_size=bytes"
Sets the maximum declared size of a packet transferred
during the single call to the sending function in Live
mode. Use 0 if this value isn't used (which is default in
file mode).
Default is \-1 (automatic), which typically means MPEG-TS;
if you are going to use SRT
to send any different kind of payload, such as, for example,
wrapping a live stream in very small frames, then you can
use a bigger maximum frame size, though not greater than
1456 bytes.
.IP \fBpkt_size=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "pkt_size=bytes"
Alias for \fBpayload_size\fR.
.IP \fBpeerlatency=\fR\fImicroseconds\fR 4

The latency value (as described in \fBrcvlatency\fR) that is
set by the sender side as a minimum value for the receiver.
.IP \fBpbkeylen=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "pbkeylen=bytes"
Sender encryption key length, in bytes.
Only can be set to 0, 16, 24 and 32.
Enable sender encryption if not 0.
Not required on receiver (set to 0),
key size obtained from sender in HaiCrypt handshake.
Default value is 0.
.IP \fBrcvlatency=\fR\fImicroseconds\fR 4
.IX Item "rcvlatency=microseconds"
The time that should elapse since the moment when the
packet was sent and the moment when it's delivered to
the receiver application in the receiving function.
This time should be a buffer time large enough to cover
the time spent for sending, unexpectedly extended RTT
time, and the time needed to retransmit the lost UDP
packet. The effective latency value will be the maximum
of this options' value and the value of \fBpeerlatency\fR
set by the peer side. Before version 1.3.0 this option
is only available as \fBlatency\fR.
.IP \fBrecv_buffer_size=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "recv_buffer_size=bytes"
Set UDP receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.

.IX Item "send_buffer_size=bytes"
Set UDP send buffer size, expressed in bytes.
.IP \fBtimeout=\fR\fImicroseconds\fR 4
.IX Item "timeout=microseconds"
Set raise error timeouts for read, write and connect operations. Note that the
SRT library has internal timeouts which can be controlled separately, the
value set here is only a cap on those.
.IP \fBtlpktdrop=\fR\fI1|0\fR 4
.IX Item "tlpktdrop=1|0"
Too-late Packet Drop. When enabled on receiver, it skips
missing packets that have not been delivered in time and
delivers the following packets to the application when
their time-to-play has come. It also sends a fake ACK to
the sender. When enabled on sender and enabled on the
receiving peer, the sender drops the older packets that
have no chance of being delivered in time. It was
automatically enabled in the sender if the receiver
supports it.
.IP \fBsndbuf=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "sndbuf=bytes"
Set send buffer size, expressed in bytes.
.IP \fBrcvbuf=\fR\fIbytes\fR 4
.IX Item "rcvbuf=bytes"
Set receive buffer size, expressed in bytes.
.Sp
Receive buffer must not be greater than \fBffs\fR.
.IP \fBlossmaxttl=\fR\fIpackets\fR 4
.IX Item "lossmaxttl=packets"
The value up to which the Reorder Tolerance may grow. When
Reorder Tolerance is > 0, then packet loss report is delayed
until that number of packets come in. Reorder Tolerance
increases every time a "belated" packet has come, but it
wasn't due to retransmission (that is, when UDP packets tend
to come out of order), with the difference between the latest
sequence and this packet's sequence, and not more than the
value of this option. By default it's 0, which means that this
mechanism is turned off, and the loss report is always sent
immediately upon experiencing a "gap" in sequences.
.IP \fBminversion\fR 4
.IX Item "minversion"
The minimum SRT version that is required from the peer. A connection
to a peer that does not satisfy the minimum version requirement
will be rejected.
.Sp
The version format in hex is 0xXXYYZZ for x.y.z in human readable
form.
.IP \fBstreamid=\fR\fIstring\fR 4
.IX Item "streamid=string"
A string limited to 512 characters that can be set on the socket prior
to connecting. This stream ID will be able to be retrieved by the
listener side from the socket that is returned from srt_accept and
was connected by a socket with that set stream ID. SRT does not enforce
any special interpretation of the contents of this string.
This option doesn’t make sense in Rendezvous connection; the result
might be that simply one side will override the value from the other
side and it’s the matter of luck which one would win
.IP \fBsrt_streamid=\fR\fIstring\fR 4
.IX Item "srt_streamid=string"
Alias for \fBstreamid\fR to avoid conflict with ffmpeg command line option.
.IP \fBsmoother=\fR\fIlive|file\fR 4
.IX Item "smoother=live|file"
The type of Smoother used for the transmission for that socket, which
is responsible for the transmission and congestion control. The Smoother
type must be exactly the same on both connecting parties, otherwise
the connection is rejected.
.IP \fBmessageapi=\fR\fI1|0\fR 4
.IX Item "messageapi=1|0"
When set, this socket uses the Message API, otherwise it uses Buffer
API. Note that in live mode (see \fBtranstype\fR) there’s only
message API available. In File mode you can chose to use one of two modes:
.Sp
Stream API (default, when this option is false). In this mode you may
send as many data as you wish with one sending instruction, or even use
dedicated functions that read directly from a file. The internal facility
will take care of any speed and congestion control. When receiving, you
can also receive as many data as desired, the data not extracted will be
waiting for the next call. There is no boundary between data portions in
the Stream mode.
.Sp
Message API. In this mode your single sending instruction passes exactly
one piece of data that has boundaries (a message). Contrary to Live mode,
this message may span across multiple UDP packets and the only size
limitation is that it shall fit as a whole in the sending buffer. The

If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the CA
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With other backends,
the host name is validated as well.)

.Ve
.PP
\&\fIoptions\fR contains a list of &\-separated options of the form \fIkey\fR=\fIval\fR.
.PP
In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows one to reduce loss of data due to
UDP socket buffer overruns. The \fIfifo_size\fR and
\&\fIoverrun_nonfatal\fR options are related to this buffer.
.PP
The list of supported options follows.
.IP \fBbuffer_size=\fR\fIsize\fR 4
.IX Item "buffer_size=size"
Set the UDP maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is used to set either
the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 32 KB for output, 384 KB for input.  See also \fIfifo_size\fR.
.IP \fBbitrate=\fR\fIbitrate\fR 4
.IX Item "bitrate=bitrate"
If set to nonzero, the output will have the specified constant bitrate if the
input has enough packets to sustain it.
.IP \fBburst_bits=\fR\fIbits\fR 4
.IX Item "burst_bits=bits"
When using \fIbitrate\fR this specifies the maximum number of bits in
packet bursts.
.IP \fBlocalport=\fR\fIport\fR 4

Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.
.IP \fBreuse=\fR\fI1|0\fR 4
.IX Item "reuse=1|0"
Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.
.IP \fBttl=\fR\fIttl\fR 4
.IX Item "ttl=ttl"
Set the time to live value (for multicast only).
.IP \fBconnect=\fR\fI1|0\fR 4
.IX Item "connect=1|0"
Initialize the UDP socket with \f(CWconnect()\fR. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
unreachable" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.
.IP \fBsources=\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB[,\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB]\fR 4
.IX Item "sources=address[,address]"
Only receive packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast,
also subscribe to multicast traffic coming from these addresses only.
.IP \fBblock=\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB[,\fR\fIaddress\fR\fB]\fR 4
.IX Item "block=address[,address]"
Ignore packets sent from the specified addresses. In case of multicast, also
exclude the source addresses in the multicast subscription.
.IP \fBfifo_size=\fR\fIunits\fR 4
.IX Item "fifo_size=units"
Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.
.IP \fBoverrun_nonfatal=\fR\fI1|0\fR 4

.SS zmq
.IX Subsection "zmq"
ZeroMQ asynchronous messaging using the libzmq library.
.PP
This library supports unicast streaming to multiple clients without relying on
an external server.
.PP
The required syntax for streaming or connecting to a stream is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        zmq:tcp://ip\-address:port
.Ve
.PP
Example:
Create a localhost stream on port 5555:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-re \-i input \-f mpegts zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
.Ve
.PP
Multiple clients may connect to the stream using:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffplay zmq:tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
.Ve
.PP
Streaming to multiple clients is implemented using a ZeroMQ Pub-Sub pattern.
The server side binds to a port and publishes data. Clients connect to the
server (via IP address/port) and subscribe to the stream. The order in which
the server and client start generally does not matter.
.PP
ffmpeg must be compiled with the \-\-enable\-libzmq option to support
this protocol.
.PP
Options can be set on the \fBffmpeg\fR/\fBffplay\fR command
line. The following options are supported:
.IP \fBpkt_size\fR 4
.IX Item "pkt_size"
Forces the maximum packet size for sending/receiving data. The default value is
131,072 bytes. On the server side, this sets the maximum size of sent packets
via ZeroMQ. On the clients, it sets an internal buffer size for receiving
packets. Note that pkt_size on the clients should be equal to or greater than
pkt_size on the server. Otherwise the received message may be truncated causing
decoding errors.
.SH "DEVICE OPTIONS"
.IX Header "DEVICE OPTIONS"
The libavdevice library provides the same interface as
libavformat. Namely, an input device is considered like a demuxer, and
an output device like a muxer, and the interface and generic device
options are the same provided by libavformat (see the ffmpeg-formats
manual).
.PP
In addition each input or output device may support so-called private
options, which are specific for that component.
.PP
Options may be set by specifying \-\fIoption\fR \fIvalue\fR in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the device
\&\f(CW\*(C`AVFormatContext\*(C'\fR options or using the \fIlibavutil/opt.h\fR API

.PP
This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.
.PP
An ALSA identifier has the syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]
.Ve
.PP
where the \fIDEV\fR and \fISUBDEV\fR components are optional.
.PP
The three arguments (in order: \fICARD\fR,\fIDEV\fR,\fISUBDEV\fR)

The decklink input device provides capture capabilities for Blackmagic
DeckLink devices.
.PP
To enable this input device, you need the Blackmagic DeckLink SDK and you
need to configure with the appropriate \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extra\-cflags\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`\-\-extra\-ldflags\*(C'\fR.
On Windows, you need to run the IDL files through \fBwidl\fR.
.PP
DeckLink is very picky about the formats it supports. Pixel format of the
input can be set with \fBraw_format\fR.
Framerate and video size must be determined for your device with
\&\fB\-list_formats 1\fR. Audio sample rate is always 48 kHz and the number
of channels can be 2, 8 or 16. Note that all audio channels are bundled in one single
audio track.

This sets the input video format to the format given by the FourCC. To see
the supported values of your device(s) use \fBlist_formats\fR.
Note that there is a FourCC \fB'pal '\fR that can also be used
as \fBpal\fR (3 letters).
Default behavior is autodetection of the input video format, if the hardware

.IP \fBteletext_lines\fR 4
.IX Item "teletext_lines"
If set to nonzero, an additional teletext stream will be captured from the
vertical ancillary data. Both SD PAL (576i) and HD (1080i or 1080p)
sources are supported. In case of HD sources, OP47 packets are decoded.
.Sp
This option is a bitmask of the SD PAL VBI lines captured, specifically lines 6
to 22, and lines 318 to 335. Line 6 is the LSB in the mask. Selected lines
which do not contain teletext information will be ignored. You can use the
special \fBall\fR constant to select all possible lines, or
\&\fBstandard\fR to skip lines 6, 318 and 319, which are not compatible with
all receivers.
.Sp
For SD sources, ffmpeg needs to be compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libzvbi\*(C'\fR. For
HD sources, on older (pre\-4K) DeckLink card models you have to capture in 10
bit mode.
.IP \fBchannels\fR 4
.IX Item "channels"
Defines number of audio channels to capture. Must be \fB2\fR, \fB8\fR or \fB16\fR.
Defaults to \fB2\fR.

\&\fBone_sub_device_full\fR, \fBone_sub_device_half\fR, \fBtwo_sub_device_full\fR,
\&\fBfour_sub_device_half\fR
Defaults to \fBunset\fR.
.Sp
Note: DeckLink SDK 11.0 have replaced the duplex property by a profile property.
For the DeckLink Duo 2 and DeckLink Quad 2, a profile is shared between any 2
sub-devices that utilize the same connectors. For the DeckLink 8K Pro, a profile
is shared between all 4 sub-devices. So DeckLink 8K Pro support four profiles.
.Sp
Valid profile modes for DeckLink 8K Pro(with DeckLink SDK >= 11.0):
\&\fBone_sub_device_full\fR, \fBone_sub_device_half\fR, \fBtwo_sub_device_full\fR,
\&\fBfour_sub_device_half\fR
.Sp
Valid profile modes for DeckLink Quad 2 and DeckLink Duo 2:

Defaults to \fBnone\fR (not included).
.Sp
In order to properly support 50/60 fps timecodes, the ordering of the queried
timecode types for \fBrp188any\fR is HFR, VITC1, VITC2 and LTC for >30 fps
content. Note that this is slightly different to the ordering used by the

Sets the audio sample bit depth. Must be \fB16\fR or \fB32\fR.
Defaults to \fB16\fR.
.IP \fBdecklink_copyts\fR 4
.IX Item "decklink_copyts"
If set to \fBtrue\fR, timestamps are forwarded as they are without removing
the initial offset.
Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP \fBtimestamp_align\fR 4
.IX Item "timestamp_align"
Capture start time alignment in seconds. If set to nonzero, input frames are
dropped till the system timestamp aligns with configured value.
Alignment difference of up to one frame duration is tolerated.
This is useful for maintaining input synchronization across N different
hardware devices deployed for 'N\-way' redundancy. The system time of different
hardware devices should be synchronized with protocols such as NTP or PTP,
before using this option.
Note that this method is not foolproof. In some border cases input
synchronization may not happen due to thread scheduling jitters in the OS.
Either sync could go wrong by 1 frame or in a rarer case
\&\fBtimestamp_align\fR seconds.
Defaults to \fB0\fR.
.IP "\fBwait_for_tc (\fR\fIbool\fR\fB)\fR" 4
.IX Item "wait_for_tc (bool)"
Drop frames till a frame with timecode is received. Sometimes serial timecode
isn't received with the first input frame. If that happens, the stored stream
timecode will be inaccurate. If this option is set to \fBtrue\fR, input frames
are dropped till a frame with timecode is received.
Option \fItimecode_format\fR must be specified.
Defaults to \fBfalse\fR.
.IP \fBenable_klv(\fR\fIbool\fR\fB)\fR 4

each audio channel, with name \fIclient_name\fR:input_\fIN\fR, where
\&\fIclient_name\fR is the name provided by the application, and \fIN\fR
is a number which identifies the channel.
Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input
device.
.PP
Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.
.PP
To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the \fBjack_connect\fR
and \fBjack_disconnect\fR programs, or do it through a graphical interface,
for example with \fBqjackctl\fR.
.PP
To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
\&\fBjack_lsp\fR.
.PP
Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
with \fBffmpeg\fR.

screen. This option overwrites the \fIvideo_size\fR, \fIgrab_x\fR, and
\&\fIgrab_y\fR options. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBdraw_mouse\fR 4
.IX Item "draw_mouse"
Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of \f(CW0\fR specifies
not to draw the pointer. Default value is \f(CW1\fR.
.IP \fBfollow_mouse\fR 4
.IX Item "follow_mouse"
Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be
\&\f(CW\*(C`centered\*(C'\fR or a number of pixels \fIPIXELS\fR.
.Sp
When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse
pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region
follows only when the mouse pointer reaches within \fIPIXELS\fR (greater than
zero) to the edge of region.
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f x11grab \-follow_mouse centered \-framerate 25 \-video_size cif \-i :0.0 out.mpg
.Ve
.Sp
To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f x11grab \-follow_mouse 100 \-framerate 25 \-video_size cif \-i :0.0 out.mpg
.Ve
.IP \fBframerate\fR 4
.IX Item "framerate"

corresponding to a frame rate of \f(CW\*(C`30000/1001\*(C'\fR.
.IP \fBshow_region\fR 4
.IX Item "show_region"
Show grabbed region on screen.
.Sp
If \fIshow_region\fR is specified with \f(CW1\fR, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.
.IP \fBregion_border\fR 4
.IX Item "region_border"
Set the region border thickness if \fB\-show_region 1\fR is used.
Range is 1 to 128 and default is 3 (XCB-based x11grab only).
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f x11grab \-show_region 1 \-framerate 25 \-video_size cif \-i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg
.Ve
.Sp
With \fIfollow_mouse\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-f x11grab \-follow_mouse centered \-show_region 1 \-framerate 25 \-video_size cif \-i :0.0 out.mpg
.Ve
.IP \fBwindow_id\fR 4
.IX Item "window_id"
Grab this window, instead of the whole screen. Default value is 0, which maps to
the whole screen (root window).
.Sp
The id of a window can be found using the \fBxwininfo\fR program, possibly with options \-tree and
\&\-root.
.Sp
If the window is later enlarged, the new area is not recorded. Video ends when
the window is closed, unmapped (i.e., iconified) or shrunk beyond the video
size (which defaults to the initial window size).
.Sp
This option disables options \fBfollow_mouse\fR and \fBselect_region\fR.

For swr only, when enabled, try to use exact phase_count based on input and
output sample rate. However, if it is larger than \f(CW\*(C`1 << phase_shift\*(C'\fR,
the phase_count will be \f(CW\*(C`1 << phase_shift\*(C'\fR as fallback. Default is enabled.
.IP \fBcutoff\fR 4
.IX Item "cutoff"
Set cutoff frequency (swr: 6dB point; soxr: 0dB point) ratio; must be a float
value between 0 and 1.  Default value is 0.97 with swr, and 0.91 with soxr
(which, with a sample-rate of 44100, preserves the entire audio band to 20kHz).
.IP \fBprecision\fR 4
.IX Item "precision"
For soxr only, the precision in bits to which the resampled signal will be
calculated.  The default value of 20 (which, with suitable dithering, is
appropriate for a destination bit-depth of 16) gives SoX's 'High Quality'; a

approximation for 'irrational' ratios. Default value is 0.
.IP \fBasync\fR 4
.IX Item "async"
For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps using stretching,
squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting this to 1 will enable filling and
trimming, larger values represent the maximum amount in samples that the data
may be stretched or squeezed for each second.
Default value is 0, thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
the audio timestamps.
.IP \fBfirst_pts\fR 4
.IX Item "first_pts"
For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The time unit is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.
.IP \fBmin_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "min_comp"
For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in

.IP \fBmin_hard_comp\fR 4
.IX Item "min_hard_comp"
For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples to make it match the

.SH "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
.IX Header "FILTERING INTRODUCTION"
Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.
.PP
In libavfilter, a filter can have multiple inputs and multiple
outputs.
To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible, we consider the
following filtergraph.
.PP
.Vb 5
\&                        [main]
\&        input \-\-> split \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-> overlay \-\-> output
\&                    |                             ^
\&                    |[tmp]                  [flip]|
\&                    +\-\-\-\-\-> crop \-\-> vflip \-\-\-\-\-\-\-+
.Ve
.PP
This filtergraph splits the input stream in two streams, then sends one
stream through the crop filter and the vflip filter, before merging it
back with the other stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the
following command to achieve this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-vf "split [main][tmp]; [tmp] crop=iw:ih/2:0:0, vflip [flip]; [main][flip] overlay=0:H/2" OUTPUT
.Ve
.PP
The result will be that the top half of the video is mirrored
onto the bottom half of the output video.
.PP
Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas, and distinct
linear chains of filters are separated by semicolons. In our example,
\&\fIcrop,vflip\fR are in one linear chain, \fIsplit\fR and
\&\fIoverlay\fR are separately in another. The points where the linear
chains join are labelled by names enclosed in square brackets. In the
example, the split filter generates two outputs that are associated to
the labels \fI[main]\fR and \fI[tmp]\fR.
.PP
The stream sent to the second output of \fIsplit\fR, labelled as
\&\fI[tmp]\fR, is processed through the \fIcrop\fR filter, which crops
away the lower half part of the video, and then vertically flipped. The
\&\fIoverlay\fR filter takes in input the first unchanged output of the
split filter (which was labelled as \fI[main]\fR), and overlay on its
lower half the output generated by the \fIcrop,vflip\fR filterchain.
.PP
Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each other
by a colon.
.PP
There exist so-called \fIsource filters\fR that do not have an
audio/video input, and \fIsink filters\fR that will not have audio/video
output.
.SH GRAPH
.IX Header "GRAPH"
The \fIgraph2dot\fR program included in the FFmpeg \fItools\fR

Invoke the command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        graph2dot \-h
.Ve
.PP
to see how to use \fIgraph2dot\fR.
.PP
You can then pass the dot description to the \fIdot\fR program (from
the graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation
of the filtergraph.
.PP
For example the sequence of commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \e
\&        tools/graph2dot \-o graph.tmp && \e
\&        dot \-Tpng graph.tmp \-o graph.png && \e
\&        display graph.png
.Ve
.PP
can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
described by the \fIGRAPH_DESCRIPTION\fR string. Note that this string must be
a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs explicitly defined.
For example if your command line is of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i infile \-vf scale=640:360 outfile
.Ve
.PP
your \fIGRAPH_DESCRIPTION\fR string will need to be of the form:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink
.Ve
.PP
you may also need to set the \fInullsrc\fR parameters and add a \fIformat\fR
filter in order to simulate a specific input file.
.SH "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION"
A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of
filters. Each link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one
filter from which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other
side connecting it to one filter accepting its output.
.PP
Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
registered in the application, which defines the features and the
number of input and output pads of the filter.
.PP
A filter with no input pads is called a "source", and a filter with no
output pads is called a "sink".
.SS "Filtergraph syntax"
.IX Subsection "Filtergraph syntax"
A filtergraph has a textual representation, which is recognized by the
\&\fB\-filter\fR/\fB\-vf\fR/\fB\-af\fR and
\&\fB\-filter_complex\fR options in \fBffmpeg\fR and
\&\fB\-vf\fR/\fB\-af\fR in \fBffplay\fR, and by the
\&\f(CWavfilter_graph_parse_ptr()\fR function defined in
\&\fIlibavfilter/avfilter.h\fR.
.PP
A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
represented by a list of ","\-separated filter descriptions.
.PP
A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
filterchains is represented by a list of ";"\-separated filterchain
descriptions.
.PP
A filter is represented by a string of the form:
[\fIin_link_1\fR]...[\fIin_link_N\fR]\fIfilter_name\fR@\fIid\fR=\fIarguments\fR[\fIout_link_1\fR]...[\fIout_link_M\fR]
.PP
\&\fIfilter_name\fR is the name of the filter class of which the
described filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of
the filter classes registered in the program optionally followed by "@\fIid\fR".
The name of the filter class is optionally followed by a string
"=\fIarguments\fR".
.PP
\&\fIarguments\fR is a string which contains the parameters used to
initialize the filter instance. It may have one of two forms:
.IP \(bu 4
A ':'\-separated list of \fIkey=value\fR pairs.
.IP \(bu 4
A ':'\-separated list of \fIvalue\fR. In this case, the keys are assumed to be
the option names in the order they are declared. E.g. the \f(CW\*(C`fade\*(C'\fR filter
declares three options in this order \-\- \fBtype\fR, \fBstart_frame\fR and
\&\fBnb_frames\fR. Then the parameter list \fIin:0:30\fR means that the value
\&\fIin\fR is assigned to the option \fBtype\fR, \fI0\fR to
\&\fBstart_frame\fR and \fI30\fR to \fBnb_frames\fR.
.IP \(bu 4
A ':'\-separated list of mixed direct \fIvalue\fR and long \fIkey=value\fR
pairs. The direct \fIvalue\fR must precede the \fIkey=value\fR pairs, and
follow the same constraints order of the previous point. The following
\&\fIkey=value\fR pairs can be set in any preferred order.
.PP
If the option value itself is a list of items (e.g. the \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR filter
takes a list of pixel formats), the items in the list are usually separated by
\&\fB|\fR.
.PP
The list of arguments can be quoted using the character \fB'\fR as initial
and ending mark, and the character \fB\e\fR for escaping the characters
within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
\&\fB[]=;,\fR) is encountered.
.PP
A special syntax implemented in the \fBffmpeg\fR CLI tool allows loading
option values from files. This is done be prepending a slash '/' to the option
name, then the supplied value is interpreted as a path from which the actual
value is loaded. E.g.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i <INPUT> \-vf drawtext=/text=/tmp/some_text <OUTPUT>
.Ve
.PP
will load the text to be drawn from \fI/tmp/some_text\fR. API users wishing to
implement a similar feature should use the \f(CW\*(C`avfilter_graph_segment_*()\*(C'\fR
functions together with custom IO code.
.PP
The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
followed by a list of link labels.
A link label allows one to name a link and associate it to a filter output
or input pad. The preceding labels \fIin_link_1\fR
\&... \fIin_link_N\fR, are associated to the filter input pads,
the following labels \fIout_link_1\fR ... \fIout_link_M\fR, are
associated to the output pads.
.PP
When two link labels with the same name are found in the
filtergraph, a link between the corresponding input and output pad is
created.
.PP
If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.
For example in the filterchain
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink
.Ve
.PP
the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
"L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled "L2", and the second
output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay,
which are both unlabelled.
.PP
In a filter description, if the input label of the first filter is not
specified, "in" is assumed; if the output label of the last filter is not
specified, "out" is assumed.
.PP
In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.
.PP
Leading and trailing whitespaces (space, tabs, or line feeds) separating tokens
in the filtergraph specification are ignored. This means that the filtergraph
can be expressed using empty lines and spaces to improve redability.
.PP
For example, the filtergraph:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        testsrc,split[L1],hflip[L2];[L1][L2] hstack
.Ve
.PP
can be represented as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        testsrc,
\&        split [L1], hflip [L2];
\&        
\&        [L1][L2] hstack
.Ve
.PP
Libavfilter will automatically insert \fBscale\fR filters where format
conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags
for those automatically inserted scalers by prepending
\&\f(CW\*(C`sws_flags=\fR\f(CIflags\fR\f(CW;\*(C'\fR
to the filtergraph description.
.PP
Here is a BNF description of the filtergraph syntax:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        <NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and \*(Aq_\*(Aq
\&        <FILTER_NAME>      ::= <NAME>["@"<NAME>]

.SS "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
.IX Subsection "Notes on filtergraph escaping"
Filtergraph description composition entails several levels of
escaping. See \fBthe "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR for more
information about the employed escaping procedure.
.PP
A first level escaping affects the content of each filter option
value, which may contain the special character \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR used to
separate values, or one of the escaping characters \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(Aq\*(C'\fR.
.PP
A second level escaping affects the whole filter description, which
may contain the escaping characters \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(Aq\*(C'\fR or the special
characters \f(CW\*(C`[],;\*(C'\fR used by the filtergraph description.
.PP
Finally, when you specify a filtergraph on a shell commandline, you
need to perform a third level escaping for the shell special
characters contained within it.
.PP
For example, consider the following string to be embedded in
the \fBdrawtext\fR filter description \fBtext\fR value:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        this is a \*(Aqstring\*(Aq: may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
This string contains the \f(CW\*(C`\*(Aq\*(C'\fR special escaping character, and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR special character, so it needs to be escaped in this way:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        text=this is a \e\*(Aqstring\e\*(Aq\e: may contain one, or more, special characters
.Ve
.PP
A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
description in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e\*(Aqstring\e\e\e\*(Aq\e\e: may contain one\e, or more\e, special characters
.Ve
.PP
(note that in addition to the \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(Aq\*(C'\fR escaping special characters,
also \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR needs to be escaped).
.PP
Finally an additional level of escaping is needed when writing the
filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that
\&\f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR is special and needs to be escaped with another \f(CW\*(C`\e\*(C'\fR, the
previous string will finally result in:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-vf "drawtext=text=this is a \e\e\e\e\e\e\*(Aqstring\e\e\e\e\e\e\*(Aq\e\e\e\e: may contain one\e\e, or more\e\e, special characters"
.Ve
.PP
In order to avoid cumbersome escaping when using a commandline tool accepting a
filter specification as input, it is advisable to avoid direct inclusion of the
filter or options specification in the shell.
.PP
For example, in case of the \fBdrawtext filter\fR, you might prefer to
use the \fBtextfile\fR option in place of \fBtext\fR to specify the text
to render.
.PP
When using the \fBffmpeg\fR tool, you might consider to use the
\&\fB\-filter_script option\fR or
\&\fB\-filter_complex_script option\fR.
.SH "TIMELINE EDITING"
.IX Header "TIMELINE EDITING"
Some filters support a generic \fBenable\fR option. For the filters
supporting timeline editing, this option can be set to an expression which is
evaluated before sending a frame to the filter. If the evaluation is non-zero,
the filter will be enabled, otherwise the frame will be sent unchanged to the
next filter in the filtergraph.
.PP
The expression accepts the following values:
.IP \fBt\fR 4
.IX Item "t"
timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is unknown
.IP \fBn\fR 4
.IX Item "n"
sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0
.IP \fBpos\fR 4
.IX Item "pos"
the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown; deprecated, do
not use
.IP \fBw\fR 4
.IX Item "w"
.PD 0
.IP \fBh\fR 4
.IX Item "h"
.PD
width and height of the input frame if video
.PP
Additionally, these filters support an \fBenable\fR command that can be used
to re-define the expression.
.PP
Like any other filtering option, the \fBenable\fR option follows the same
rules.
.PP
For example, to enable a blur filter (\fBsmartblur\fR) from 10 seconds to 3
minutes, and a \fBcurves\fR filter starting at 3 seconds:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        smartblur = enable=\*(Aqbetween(t,10,3*60)\*(Aq,
\&        curves    = enable=\*(Aqgte(t,3)\*(Aq : preset=cross_process

.PP
Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.
.SS acompressor
.IX Subsection "acompressor"
A compressor is mainly used to reduce the dynamic range of a signal.
Especially modern music is mostly compressed at a high ratio to
improve the overall loudness. It's done to get the highest attention
of a listener, "fatten" the sound and bring more "power" to the track.
If a signal is compressed too much it may sound dull or "dead"
afterwards or it may start to "pump" (which could be a powerful effect
but can also destroy a track completely).
The right compression is the key to reach a professional sound and is
the high art of mixing and mastering. Because of its complex settings
it may take a long time to get the right feeling for this kind of effect.
.PP
Compression is done by detecting the volume above a chosen level
\&\f(CW\*(C`threshold\*(C'\fR and dividing it by the factor set with \f(CW\*(C`ratio\*(C'\fR.
So if you set the threshold to \-12dB and your signal reaches \-6dB a ratio
of 2:1 will result in a signal at \-9dB. Because an exact manipulation of
the signal would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be
levelled over the time. This is done by setting "Attack" and "Release".
\&\f(CW\*(C`attack\*(C'\fR determines how long the signal has to rise above the threshold
before any reduction will occur and \f(CW\*(C`release\*(C'\fR sets the time the signal
has to fall below the threshold to reduce the reduction again. Shorter signals
than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.
The overall reduction of the signal can be made up afterwards with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`makeup\*(C'\fR setting. So compressing the peaks of a signal about 6dB and
raising the makeup to this level results in a signal twice as loud than the
source. To gain a softer entry in the compression the \f(CW\*(C`knee\*(C'\fR flattens the
hard edge at the threshold in the range of the chosen decibels.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBlevel_in\fR 4
.IX Item "level_in"
Set input gain. Default is 1. Range is between 0.015625 and 64.

.IP \fBratio\fR 4
.IX Item "ratio"
Set a ratio by which the signal is reduced. 1:2 means that if the level

Default is 2. Range is between 1 and 20.
.IP \fBattack\fR 4
.IX Item "attack"
Amount of milliseconds the signal has to rise above the threshold before gain

.IX Item "link"
Choose if the \f(CW\*(C`average\*(C'\fR level between all channels of input stream

.SS acrusher
.IX Subsection "acrusher"
Reduce audio bit resolution.
.PP
This filter is bit crusher with enhanced functionality. A bit crusher
is used to audibly reduce number of bits an audio signal is sampled
with. This doesn't change the bit depth at all, it just produces the
effect. Material reduced in bit depth sounds more harsh and "digital".
This filter is able to even round to continuous values instead of discrete
bit depths.
Additionally it has a D/C offset which results in different crushing of
the lower and the upper half of the signal.
An Anti-Aliasing setting is able to produce "softer" crushing sounds.
.PP
Another feature of this filter is the logarithmic mode.
This setting switches from linear distances between bits to logarithmic ones.
The result is a much more "natural" sounding crusher which doesn't gate low
signals for example. The human ear has a logarithmic perception,
so this kind of crushing is much more pleasant.
Logarithmic crushing is also able to get anti-aliased.

.IX Subsection "agate"
A gate is mainly used to reduce lower parts of a signal. This kind of signal
processing reduces disturbing noise between useful signals.
.PP
Gating is done by detecting the volume below a chosen level \fIthreshold\fR
and dividing it by the factor set with \fIratio\fR. The bottom of the noise
floor is set via \fIrange\fR. Because an exact manipulation of the signal
would cause distortion of the waveform the reduction can be levelled over
time. This is done by setting \fIattack\fR and \fIrelease\fR.
.PP
\&\fIattack\fR determines how long the signal has to fall below the threshold
before any reduction will occur and \fIrelease\fR sets the time the signal
has to rise above the threshold to reduce the reduction again.
Shorter signals than the chosen attack time will be left untouched.

The limiter prevents an input signal from rising over a desired threshold.
This limiter uses lookahead technology to prevent your signal from distorting.
It means that there is a small delay after the signal is processed. Keep in mind
that the delay it produces is the attack time you set.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBlevel_in\fR 4
.IX Item "level_in"

.SS amerge
.IX Subsection "amerge"
Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBinputs\fR 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.
.PP
If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore compatible,
the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly and the channels
will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts of the inputs are not
disjoint, the output will have all the channels of the first input then all
the channels of the second input, in that order, and the channel layout of
the output will be the default value corresponding to the total number of
channels.
.PP
For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second input
is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in the
following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of the
first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).
.PP
On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels will be
in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout will be
arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected value.
.PP
All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

.SS apulsator
.IX Subsection "apulsator"
Audio pulsator is something between an autopanner and a tremolo.
But it can produce funny stereo effects as well. Pulsator changes the volume
of the left and right channel based on a LFO (low frequency oscillator) with
different waveforms and shifted phases.
This filter have the ability to define an offset between left and right
channel. An offset of 0 means that both LFO shapes match each other.
The left and right channel are altered equally \- a conventional tremolo.
An offset of 50% means that the shape of the right channel is exactly shifted
in phase (or moved backwards about half of the frequency) \- pulsator acts as
an autopanner. At 1 both curves match again. Every setting in between moves the
phase shift gapless between all stages and produces some "bypassing" sounds with
sine and triangle waveforms. The more you set the offset near 1 (starting from
the 0.5) the faster the signal passes from the left to the right speaker.

.SS atrim
.IX Subsection "atrim"
Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP \fBstart\fR 4
.IX Item "start"
Timestamp (in seconds) of the start of the section to keep. I.e. the audio
sample with the timestamp \fIstart\fR will be the first sample in the output.
.IP \fBend\fR 4
.IX Item "end"
Specify time of the first audio sample that will be dropped, i.e. the
audio sample immediately preceding the one with the timestamp \fIend\fR will be
the last sample in the output.
.IP \fBstart_pts\fR 4
.IX Item "start_pts"
Same as \fIstart\fR, except this option sets the start timestamp in samples
instead of seconds.
.IP \fBend_pts\fR 4
.IX Item "end_pts"
Same as \fIend\fR, except this option sets the end timestamp in samples instead
of seconds.
.IP \fBduration\fR 4
.IX Item "duration"

.IP \fBstart_sample\fR 4
.IX Item "start_sample"
The number of the first sample that should be output.
.IP \fBend_sample\fR 4
.IX Item "end_sample"
The number of the first sample that should be dropped.
.PP
\&\fBstart\fR, \fBend\fR, and \fBduration\fR are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
\&\fBthe Time duration section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR.
.PP
Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the \fBduration\fR
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _sample options simply count the
samples that pass through the filter. So start/end_pts and start/end_sample will
give different results when the timestamps are wrong, inexact or do not start at
zero. Also note that this filter does not modify the timestamps. If you wish
to have the output timestamps start at zero, insert the asetpts filter after the
atrim filter.
.PP
If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all samples that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple atrim
filters.
.PP
The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.
.PP
Examples:
.IP \(bu 4
Drop everything except the second minute of input:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ffmpeg \-i INPUT \-af atrim=60:120
.Ve

.SS axcorrelate
.IX Subsection "axcorrelate"
Calculate normalized windowed cross-correlation between two input audio streams.
.PP
Resulted samples are always between \-1 and 1 inclusive.
If result is 1 it means two input samples are highly correlated in that selected segment.
Result 0 means they are not correlated at all.
If result is \-1 it means two input samples are out of phase, which means they cancel each
other.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBsize\fR 4
.IX Item "size"
Set size of segment over which cross-correlation is calculated.
Default is 256. Allowed range is from 2 to 131072.
.IP \fBalgo\fR 4
.IX Item "algo"
Set algorithm for cross-correlation. Can be \f(CW\*(C`slow\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`fast\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`best\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW\*(C`best\*(C'\fR. Fast algorithm assumes mean values over any given segment
are always zero and thus need much less calculations to make.
This is generally not true, but is valid for typical audio streams.

Can make a single vocal sound like a chorus, but can also be applied to instrumentation.
.PP
Chorus resembles an echo effect with a short delay, but whereas with echo the delay is
constant, with chorus, it is varied using using sinusoidal or triangular modulation.
The modulation depth defines the range the modulated delay is played before or after
the delay. Hence the delayed sound will sound slower or faster, that is the delayed
sound tuned around the original one, like in a chorus where some vocals are slightly

A list of times in seconds for each channel over which the instantaneous level
of the input signal is averaged to determine its volume. \fIattacks\fR refers to
increase of volume and \fIdecays\fR refers to decrease of volume. For most
situations, the attack time (response to the audio getting louder) should be
shorter than the decay time, because the human ear is more sensitive to sudden
loud audio than sudden soft audio. A typical value for attack is 0.3 seconds and
a typical value for decay is 0.8 seconds.
If specified number of attacks & decays is lower than number of channels, the last
set attack/decay will be used for all remaining channels.
.IP \fBpoints\fR 4
.IX Item "points"

does not have to be monotonically rising. The point \f(CW\*(C`0/0\*(C'\fR is assumed but
may be overridden (by \f(CW\*(C`0/out\-dBn\*(C'\fR). Typical values for the transfer

.SS compensationdelay
.IX Subsection "compensationdelay"
Compensation Delay Line is a metric based delay to compensate differing
positions of microphones or speakers.
.PP
For example, you have recorded guitar with two microphones placed in
different locations. Because the front of sound wave has fixed speed in
normal conditions, the phasing of microphones can vary and depends on
their location and interposition. The best sound mix can be achieved when
these microphones are in phase (synchronized). Note that a distance of
~30 cm between microphones makes one microphone capture the signal in
antiphase to the other microphone. That makes the final mix sound moody.
This filter helps to solve phasing problems by adding different delays
to each microphone track and make them synchronized.
.PP
The best result can be reached when you take one track as base and
synchronize other tracks one by one with it.
Remember that synchronization/delay tolerance depends on sample rate, too.
Higher sample rates will give more tolerance.

.IX Item "length"

.SS dynaudnorm
.IX Subsection "dynaudnorm"
Dynamic Audio Normalizer.
.PP
This filter applies a certain amount of gain to the input audio in order
to bring its peak magnitude to a target level (e.g. 0 dBFS). However, in
contrast to more "simple" normalization algorithms, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer *dynamically* re-adjusts the gain factor to the input audio.
This allows for applying extra gain to the "quiet" sections of the audio
while avoiding distortions or clipping the "loud" sections. In other words:
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer will "even out" the volume of quiet and loud
sections, in the sense that the volume of each section is brought to the
same target level. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer achieves
this goal *without* applying "dynamic range compressing". It will retain 100%
of the dynamic range *within* each section of the audio file.
.IP "\fBframelen, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "framelen, f"
Set the frame length in milliseconds. In range from 10 to 8000 milliseconds.
Default is 500 milliseconds.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer processes the input audio in small chunks,
referred to as frames. This is required, because a peak magnitude has no
meaning for just a single sample value. Instead, we need to determine the
peak magnitude for a contiguous sequence of sample values. While a "standard"
normalizer would simply use the peak magnitude of the complete file, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the peak magnitude individually for each
frame. The length of a frame is specified in milliseconds. By default, the
Dynamic Audio Normalizer uses a frame length of 500 milliseconds, which has
been found to give good results with most files.
Note that the exact frame length, in number of samples, will be determined
automatically, based on the sampling rate of the individual input audio file.
.IP "\fBgausssize, g\fR" 4
.IX Item "gausssize, g"
Set the Gaussian filter window size. In range from 3 to 301, must be odd
number. Default is 31.
Probably the most important parameter of the Dynamic Audio Normalizer is the
\&\f(CW\*(C`window size\*(C'\fR of the Gaussian smoothing filter. The filter's window size
is specified in frames, centered around the current frame. For the sake of
simplicity, this must be an odd number. Consequently, the default value of 31
takes into account the current frame, as well as the 15 preceding frames and
the 15 subsequent frames. Using a larger window results in a stronger
smoothing effect and thus in less gain variation, i.e. slower gain
adaptation. Conversely, using a smaller window results in a weaker smoothing
effect and thus in more gain variation, i.e. faster gain adaptation.
In other words, the more you increase this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a "traditional" normalization filter. On the
contrary, the more you decrease this value, the more the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer will behave like a dynamic range compressor.
.IP "\fBpeak, p\fR" 4
.IX Item "peak, p"
Set the target peak value. This specifies the highest permissible magnitude
level for the normalized audio input. This filter will try to approach the
target peak magnitude as closely as possible, but at the same time it also
makes sure that the normalized signal will never exceed the peak magnitude.
A frame's maximum local gain factor is imposed directly by the target peak
magnitude. The default value is 0.95 and thus leaves a headroom of 5%*.
It is not recommended to go above this value.
.IP "\fBmaxgain, m\fR" 4
.IX Item "maxgain, m"
Set the maximum gain factor. In range from 1.0 to 100.0. Default is 10.0.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer determines the maximum possible (local) gain
factor for each input frame, i.e. the maximum gain factor that does not
result in clipping or distortion. The maximum gain factor is determined by
the frame's highest magnitude sample. However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer
additionally bounds the frame's maximum gain factor by a predetermined
(global) maximum gain factor. This is done in order to avoid excessive gain
factors in "silent" or almost silent frames. By default, the maximum gain
factor is 10.0, For most inputs the default value should be sufficient and
it usually is not recommended to increase this value. Though, for input
with an extremely low overall volume level, it may be necessary to allow even
higher gain factors. Note, however, that the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does
not simply apply a "hard" threshold (i.e. cut off values above the threshold).
Instead, a "sigmoid" threshold function will be applied. This way, the
gain factors will smoothly approach the threshold value, but never exceed that
value.
.IP "\fBtargetrms, r\fR" 4
.IX Item "targetrms, r"
Set the target RMS. In range from 0.0 to 1.0. Default is 0.0 \- disabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer performs "peak" normalization.
This means that the maximum local gain factor for each frame is defined
(only) by the frame's highest magnitude sample. This way, the samples can
be amplified as much as possible without exceeding the maximum signal
level, i.e. without clipping. Optionally, however, the Dynamic Audio
Normalizer can also take into account the frame's root mean square,
abbreviated RMS. In electrical engineering, the RMS is commonly used to
determine the power of a time-varying signal. It is therefore considered
that the RMS is a better approximation of the "perceived loudness" than
just looking at the signal's peak magnitude. Consequently, by adjusting all
frames to a constant RMS value, a uniform "perceived loudness" can be
established. If a target RMS value has been specified, a frame's local gain
factor is defined as the factor that would result in exactly that RMS value.
Note, however, that the maximum local gain factor is still restricted by the
frame's highest magnitude sample, in order to prevent clipping.
.IP "\fBcoupling, n\fR" 4
.IX Item "coupling, n"
Enable channels coupling. By default is enabled.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will amplify all channels by the same
amount. This means the same gain factor will be applied to all channels, i.e.
the maximum possible gain factor is determined by the "loudest" channel.
However, in some recordings, it may happen that the volume of the different
channels is uneven, e.g. one channel may be "quieter" than the other one(s).
In this case, this option can be used to disable the channel coupling. This way,
the gain factor will be determined independently for each channel, depending
only on the individual channel's highest magnitude sample. This allows for
harmonizing the volume of the different channels.
.IP "\fBcorrectdc, c\fR" 4
.IX Item "correctdc, c"
Enable DC bias correction. By default is disabled.
An audio signal (in the time domain) is a sequence of sample values.
In the Dynamic Audio Normalizer these sample values are represented in the
\&\-1.0 to 1.0 range, regardless of the original input format. Normally, the
audio signal, or "waveform", should be centered around the zero point.
That means if we calculate the mean value of all samples in a file, or in a
single frame, then the result should be 0.0 or at least very close to that
value. If, however, there is a significant deviation of the mean value from
0.0, in either positive or negative direction, this is referred to as a
DC bias or DC offset. Since a DC bias is clearly undesirable, the Dynamic
Audio Normalizer provides optional DC bias correction.
With DC bias correction enabled, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer will determine
the mean value, or "DC correction" offset, of each input frame and subtract
that value from all of the frame's sample values which ensures those samples
are centered around 0.0 again. Also, in order to avoid "gaps" at the frame
boundaries, the DC correction offset values will be interpolated smoothly
between neighbouring frames.
.IP "\fBaltboundary, b\fR" 4
.IX Item "altboundary, b"
Enable alternative boundary mode. By default is disabled.
The Dynamic Audio Normalizer takes into account a certain neighbourhood
around each frame. This includes the preceding frames as well as the
subsequent frames. However, for the "boundary" frames, located at the very
beginning and at the very end of the audio file, not all neighbouring
frames are available. In particular, for the first few frames in the audio
file, the preceding frames are not known. And, similarly, for the last few
frames in the audio file, the subsequent frames are not known. Thus, the
question arises which gain factors should be assumed for the missing frames
in the "boundary" region. The Dynamic Audio Normalizer implements two modes
to deal with this situation. The default boundary mode assumes a gain factor
of exactly 1.0 for the missing frames, resulting in a smooth "fade in" and
"fade out" at the beginning and at the end of the input, respectively.
.IP "\fBcompress, s\fR" 4
.IX Item "compress, s"
Set the compress factor. In range from 0.0 to 30.0. Default is 0.0.
By default, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not apply "traditional"
compression. This means that signal peaks will not be pruned and thus the
full dynamic range will be retained within each local neighbourhood. However,
in some cases it may be desirable to combine the Dynamic Audio Normalizer's
normalization algorithm with a more "traditional" compression.
For this purpose, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer provides an optional compression
(thresholding) function. If (and only if) the compression feature is enabled,
all input frames will be processed by a soft knee thresholding function prior
to the actual normalization process. Put simply, the thresholding function is
going to prune all samples whose magnitude exceeds a certain threshold value.
However, the Dynamic Audio Normalizer does not simply apply a fixed threshold
value. Instead, the threshold value will be adjusted for each individual
frame.
In general, smaller parameters result in stronger compression, and vice versa.
Values below 3.0 are not recommended, because audible distortion may appear.
.IP "\fBthreshold, t\fR" 4
.IX Item "threshold, t"
Set the target threshold value. This specifies the lowest permissible
magnitude level for the audio input which will be normalized.
If input frame volume is above this value frame will be normalized.
Otherwise frame may not be normalized at all. The default value is set
to 0, which means all input frames will be normalized.
This option is mostly useful if digital noise is not wanted to be amplified.
.IP "\fBchannels, h\fR" 4
.IX Item "channels, h"
Specify which channels to filter, by default all available channels are filtered.
.IP "\fBoverlap, o\fR" 4
.IX Item "overlap, o"
Specify overlap for frames. If set to 0 (default) no frame overlapping is done.
Using >0 and <1 values will make less conservative gain adjustments, like
when framelen option is set to smaller value, if framelen option value is
compensated for non-zero overlap then gain adjustments will be smoother across time
compared to zero overlap case.
.IP "\fBcurve, v\fR" 4
.IX Item "curve, v"
Specify the peak mapping curve expression which is going to be used when calculating
gain applied to frames. The max output frame gain will still be limited by other

dropping the extra channels:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        pan="stereo| c0=FL | c1=FR"

.SS sidechaingate
.IX Subsection "sidechaingate"
A sidechain gate acts like a normal (wideband) gate but has the ability to
filter the detected signal before sending it to the gain reduction stage.
Normally a gate uses the full range signal to detect a level above the
threshold.
For example: If you cut all lower frequencies from your sidechain signal
the gate will decrease the volume of your track only if not enough highs
appear. With this technique you are able to reduce the resonation of a
natural drum or remove "rumbling" of muted strokes from a heavily distorted
guitar.
It needs two input streams and returns one output stream.
First input stream will be processed depending on second stream signal.

Remove silence from the beginning, middle or end of the audio.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBstart_periods\fR 4
.IX Item "start_periods"
This value is used to indicate if audio should be trimmed at beginning of
the audio. A value of zero indicates no silence should be trimmed from the
beginning. When specifying a non-zero value, it trims audio up until it
finds non-silence. Normally, when trimming silence from beginning of audio
the \fIstart_periods\fR will be \f(CW1\fR but it can be increased to higher
values to trim all audio up to specific count of non-silence periods.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBstart_duration\fR 4
.IX Item "start_duration"
Specify the amount of time that non-silence must be detected before it stops
trimming audio. By increasing the duration, bursts of noises can be treated
as silence and trimmed off. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBstart_threshold\fR 4
.IX Item "start_threshold"
This indicates what sample value should be treated as silence. For digital
audio, a value of \f(CW0\fR may be fine but for audio recorded from analog,
you may wish to increase the value to account for background noise.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBstart_silence\fR 4
.IX Item "start_silence"
Specify max duration of silence at beginning that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.
.IP \fBstart_mode\fR 4
.IX Item "start_mode"
Specify mode of detection of silence end at start of multi-channel audio.
Can be \fIany\fR or \fIall\fR. Default is \fIany\fR.
With \fIany\fR, any sample from any channel that is detected as non-silence
will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream.
With \fIall\fR, only if every sample from every channel is detected as non-silence
will trigger end of silence trimming at start of audio stream, limited usage.
.IP \fBstop_periods\fR 4
.IX Item "stop_periods"
Set the count for trimming silence from the end of audio. When specifying a
positive value, it trims audio after it finds specified silence period.
To remove silence from the middle of a file, specify a \fIstop_periods\fR
that is negative. This value is then treated as a positive value and is
used to indicate the effect should restart processing as specified by
\&\fIstop_periods\fR, making it suitable for removing periods of silence
in the middle of the audio.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBstop_duration\fR 4
.IX Item "stop_duration"
Specify a duration of silence that must exist before audio is not copied any
more. By specifying a higher duration, silence that is wanted can be left in
the audio.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBstop_threshold\fR 4
.IX Item "stop_threshold"
This is the same as \fBstart_threshold\fR but for trimming silence from
the end of audio.
Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is appended to the specified value)
or amplitude ratio. Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBstop_silence\fR 4
.IX Item "stop_silence"
Specify max duration of silence at end that will be kept after
trimming. Default is 0, which is equal to trimming all samples detected
as silence.
.IP \fBstop_mode\fR 4
.IX Item "stop_mode"
Specify mode of detection of silence start after start of multi-channel audio.
Can be \fIany\fR or \fIall\fR. Default is \fIall\fR.
With \fIany\fR, any sample from any channel that is detected as silence
will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream, limited usage.
With \fIall\fR, only if every sample from every channel is detected as silence
will trigger start of silence trimming after start of audio stream.

.PP
It means that:
.IP \(bu 4
The mean square energy is approximately \-27 dB, or 10^\-2.7.
.IP \(bu 4
The largest sample is at \-4 dB, or more precisely between \-4 dB and \-5 dB.
.IP \(bu 4
There are 6 samples at \-4 dB, 62 at \-5 dB, 286 at \-6 dB, etc.
.PP
In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any clipping,
raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.

.PP
Below is a description of the currently available video filters.
.SS addroi
.IX Subsection "addroi"
Mark a region of interest in a video frame.
.PP
The frame data is passed through unchanged, but metadata is attached
to the frame indicating regions of interest which can affect the
behaviour of later encoding.  Multiple regions can be marked by
applying the filter multiple times.
.IP \fBx\fR 4
.IX Item "x"
Region distance in pixels from the left edge of the frame.
.IP \fBy\fR 4
.IX Item "y"
Region distance in pixels from the top edge of the frame.
.IP \fBw\fR 4
.IX Item "w"
Region width in pixels.
.IP \fBh\fR 4
.IX Item "h"
Region height in pixels.

The parameters \fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIw\fR and \fIh\fR are expressions,
and may contain the following variables:
.RS 4
.IP \fBiw\fR 4
.IX Item "iw"
Width of the input frame.
.IP \fBih\fR 4
.IX Item "ih"
Height of the input frame.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP \fBqoffset\fR 4
.IX Item "qoffset"
Quantisation offset to apply within the region.
.Sp
This must be a real value in the range \-1 to +1.  A value of zero
indicates no quality change.  A negative value asks for better quality
(less quantisation), while a positive value asks for worse quality
(greater quantisation).
.Sp
The range is calibrated so that the extreme values indicate the
largest possible offset \- if the rest of the frame is encoded with the
worst possible quality, an offset of \-1 indicates that this region
should be encoded with the best possible quality anyway.  Intermediate
values are then interpolated in some codec-dependent way.
.Sp
For example, in 10\-bit H.264 the quantisation parameter varies between
\&\-12 and 51.  A typical qoffset value of \-1/10 therefore indicates that
this region should be encoded with a QP around one-tenth of the full
range better than the rest of the frame.  So, if most of the frame
were to be encoded with a QP of around 30, this region would get a QP
of around 24 (an offset of approximately \-1/10 * (51 \- \-12) = \-6.3).
An extreme value of \-1 would indicate that this region should be
encoded with the best possible quality regardless of the treatment of
the rest of the frame \- that is, should be encoded at a QP of \-12.

.SS alphamerge
.IX Subsection "alphamerge"
Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with

The filter converts the transfer characteristics, color space and color
primaries to the specified user values. The output value, if not specified,
is set to a default value based on the "all" property. If that property is
also not specified, the filter will log an error. The output color range and
format default to the same value as the input color range and format. The
input transfer characteristics, color space, color primaries and color range
should be set on the input data. If any of these are missing, the filter will
log an error and no conversion will take place.

Hardware acceleration is based on an OpenGL context. Usually, this means it is

exist which means there is no guarantee for hardware processing. It depends on
the respective OSX.
.PP
There are many filters and image generators provided by Apple that come with a
large variety of options. The filter has to be referenced by its name along
with its options.
.PP
The coreimage filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBlist_filters\fR 4

.IP \fBfilter\fR 4
.IX Item "filter"
Specify all filters by their respective name and options.
Use \fIlist_filters\fR to determine all valid filter names and options.
Numerical options are specified by a float value and are automatically clamped
to their respective value range.  Vector and color options have to be specified
by a list of space separated float values. Character escaping has to be done.
A special option name \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR is available to use default options for a
filter.
.Sp
It is required to specify either \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR or at least one of the filter options.
All omitted options are used with their default values.
The syntax of the filter string is as follows:
.Sp

.Ve
.Sp
If not given, the output rectangle equals the dimensions of the input image.
The output rectangle is automatically cropped at the borders of the input
image. Negative values are valid for each component.
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
Several filters can be chained for successive processing without GPU-HOST
transfers allowing for fast processing of complex filter chains.
Currently, only filters with zero (generators) or exactly one (filters) input
image and one output image are supported. Also, transition filters are not yet
usable as intended.
.PP
Some filters generate output images with additional padding depending on the
respective filter kernel. The padding is automatically removed to ensure the
filter output has the same size as the input image.
.PP
For image generators, the size of the output image is determined by the
previous output image of the filter chain or the input image of the whole
filterchain, respectively. The generators do not use the pixel information of
this image to generate their output. However, the generated output is
blended onto this image, resulting in partial or complete coverage of the
output image.
.PP
The \fBcoreimagesrc\fR video source can be used for generating input images
which are directly fed into the filter chain. By using it, providing input
images by another video source or an input video is not required.

Delay video filtering until a given wallclock timestamp. The filter first
passes on \fBpreroll\fR amount of frames, then it buffers at most

it forwards the buffered frames and also any subsequent frames coming in its
input.
.PP
The filter can be used synchronize the output of multiple ffmpeg processes for
realtime output devices like decklink. By putting the delay in the filtering
chain and pre-buffering frames the process can pass on data to output almost
immediately after the target wallclock timestamp is reached.

.SS curves
.IX Subsection "curves"
Apply color adjustments using curves.
.PP
This filter is similar to the Adobe Photoshop and GIMP curves tools. Each
component (red, green and blue) has its values defined by \fIN\fR key points
tied from each other using a smooth curve. The x\-axis represents the pixel
values from the input frame, and the y\-axis the new pixel values to be set for
the output frame.
.PP
By default, a component curve is defined by the two points \fI(0;0)\fR and
\&\fI(1;1)\fR. This creates a straight line where each original pixel value is
"adjusted" to its own value, which means no change to the image.
.PP
The filter allows you to redefine these two points and add some more. A new
curve will be define to pass smoothly through all these new coordinates. The
new defined points needs to be strictly increasing over the x\-axis, and their
\&\fIx\fR and \fIy\fR values must be in the \fI[0;1]\fR interval. The curve is
formed by using a natural or monotonic cubic spline interpolation, depending
on the \fIinterp\fR option (default: \f(CW\*(C`natural\*(C'\fR). The \f(CW\*(C`natural\*(C'\fR
spline produces a smoother curve in general while the monotonic (\f(CW\*(C`pchip\*(C'\fR)
spline guarantees the transitions between the specified points to be
monotonic. If the computed curves happened to go outside the vector spaces,
the values will be clipped accordingly.
.PP

\fIText expansion\fR
.IX Subsection "Text expansion"
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR, the filter recognizes
sequences accepted by the \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR C function in the provided
text and expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of
\&\f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR. This feature is deprecated in favor of \f(CW\*(C`normal\*(C'\fR
expansion with the \f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR expansion
functions.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, the text is printed verbatim.
.PP
If \fBexpansion\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`normal\*(C'\fR (which is the default),
the following expansion mechanism is used.
.PP
The backslash character \fB\e\fR, followed by any character, always expands to
the second character.
.PP
Sequences of the form \f(CW\*(C`%{...}\*(C'\fR are expanded. The text between the
braces is a function name, possibly followed by arguments separated by ':'.
If the arguments contain special characters or delimiters (':' or '}'),
they should be escaped.
.PP
Note that they probably must also be escaped as the value for the \fBtext\fR
option in the filter argument string and as the filter argument in the
filtergraph description, and possibly also for the shell, that makes up to four
levels of escaping; using a text file with the \fBtextfile\fR option avoids
these problems.
.PP
The following functions are available:
.IP "\fBexpr, e\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr, e"
The expression evaluation result.
.Sp
It must take one argument specifying the expression to be evaluated,
which accepts the same constants and functions as the \fIx\fR and
\&\fIy\fR values. Note that not all constants should be used, for
example the text size is not known when evaluating the expression, so
the constants \fItext_w\fR and \fItext_h\fR will have an undefined
value.
.IP "\fBexpr_int_format, eif\fR" 4
.IX Item "expr_int_format, eif"
Evaluate the expression's value and output as formatted integer.
.Sp
The first argument is the expression to be evaluated, just as for the \fIexpr\fR function.
The second argument specifies the output format. Allowed values are \fBx\fR,
\&\fBX\fR, \fBd\fR and \fBu\fR. They are treated exactly as in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR function.
The third parameter is optional and sets the number of positions taken by the output.
It can be used to add padding with zeros from the left.
.IP \fBgmtime\fR 4
.IX Item "gmtime"
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in UTC.
It can accept an argument: a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR C function format string.
The format string is extended to support the variable \fI%[1\-6]N\fR
which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.
.IP \fBlocaltime\fR 4
.IX Item "localtime"
The time at which the filter is running, expressed in the local time zone.
It can accept an argument: a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR C function format string.
The format string is extended to support the variable \fI%[1\-6]N\fR
which prints fractions of the second with optionally specified number of digits.
.IP \fBmetadata\fR 4
.IX Item "metadata"
Frame metadata. Takes one or two arguments.
.Sp
The first argument is mandatory and specifies the metadata key.
.Sp
The second argument is optional and specifies a default value, used when the
metadata key is not found or empty.
.Sp
Available metadata can be identified by inspecting entries
starting with TAG included within each frame section
printed by running \f(CW\*(C`ffprobe \-show_frames\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
String metadata generated in filters leading to
the drawtext filter are also available.
.IP "\fBn, frame_num\fR" 4
.IX Item "n, frame_num"
The frame number, starting from 0.
.IP \fBpict_type\fR 4
.IX Item "pict_type"
A one character description of the current picture type.
.IP \fBpts\fR 4
.IX Item "pts"
The timestamp of the current frame.
It can take up to three arguments.
.Sp
The first argument is the format of the timestamp; it defaults to \f(CW\*(C`flt\*(C'\fR
for seconds as a decimal number with microsecond accuracy; \f(CW\*(C`hms\*(C'\fR stands
for a formatted \fI[\-]HH:MM:SS.mmm\fR timestamp with millisecond accuracy.
\&\f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as UTC time;
\&\f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR stands for the timestamp of the frame formatted as
local time zone time.
.Sp
The second argument is an offset added to the timestamp.
.Sp
If the format is set to \f(CW\*(C`hms\*(C'\fR, a third argument \f(CW\*(C`24HH\*(C'\fR may be
supplied to present the hour part of the formatted timestamp in 24h format
(00\-23).
.Sp
If the format is set to \f(CW\*(C`localtime\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`gmtime\*(C'\fR, a third
argument may be supplied: a \f(CW\*(C`strftime\*(C'\fR C function format string.
By default, \fIYYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS\fR format will be used.

Syntax for the argument is the same as for filter invocation, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        fontsize=56:fontcolor=green:text=\*(AqHello World\*(Aq

.SS fieldmatch
.IX Subsection "fieldmatch"
Field matching filter for inverse telecine. It is meant to reconstruct the
progressive frames from a telecined stream. The filter does not drop duplicated
frames, so to achieve a complete inverse telecine \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR needs to be
followed by a decimation filter such as \fBdecimate\fR in the filtergraph.
.PP
The separation of the field matching and the decimation is notably motivated by
the possibility of inserting a de-interlacing filter fallback between the two.
If the source has mixed telecined and real interlaced content,
\&\f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR will not be able to match fields for the interlaced parts.
But these remaining combed frames will be marked as interlaced, and thus can be
de-interlaced by a later filter such as \fByadif\fR before decimation.
.PP
In addition to the various configuration options, \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR can take an
optional second stream, activated through the \fBppsrc\fR option. If
enabled, the frames reconstruction will be based on the fields and frames from
this second stream. This allows the first input to be pre-processed in order to
help the various algorithms of the filter, while keeping the output lossless
(assuming the fields are matched properly). Typically, a field-aware denoiser,
or brightness/contrast adjustments can help.
.PP
Note that this filter uses the same algorithms as TIVTC/TFM (AviSynth project)
and VIVTC/VFM (VapourSynth project). The later is a light clone of TFM from
which \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR is based on. While the semantic and usage are very
close, some behaviour and options names can differ.
.PP
The \fBdecimate\fR filter currently only works for constant frame rate input.
If your input has mixed telecined (30fps) and progressive content with a lower
framerate like 24fps use the following filterchain to produce the necessary cfr
stream: \f(CW\*(C`dejudder,fps=30000/1001,fieldmatch,decimate\*(C'\fR.

Set the matching mode or strategy to use. \fBpc\fR mode is the safest in the

outputting combed frames when a good match might actually exist. On the other
hand, \fBpcn_ub\fR mode is the most risky in terms of creating jerkiness,
but will almost always find a good frame if there is one. The other values are
all somewhere in between \fBpc\fR and \fBpcn_ub\fR in terms of risking
jerkiness and creating duplicate frames versus finding good matches in sections
with bad edits, orphaned fields, blended fields, etc.

Respectively set the x\-axis and y\-axis size of the window used during combed
frame detection. This has to do with the size of the area in which

declared combed. See the \fBcombpel\fR parameter description for more info.
Possible values are any number that is a power of 2 starting at 4 and going up

The number of combed pixels inside any of the \fBblocky\fR by
\&\fBblockx\fR size blocks on the frame for the frame to be detected as
combed. While \fBcthresh\fR controls how "visible" the combing must be, this
setting controls "how much" combing there must be in any localized area (a
window defined by the \fBblockx\fR and \fBblocky\fR settings) on the
frame. Minimum value is \f(CW0\fR and maximum is \f(CW\*(C`blocky x blockx\*(C'\fR (at
which point no frames will ever be detected as combed). This setting is known
as \fBMI\fR in TFM/VFM vocabulary.

We assume the following telecined stream:

\&        Top fields:     1 2 2 3 4
\&        Bottom fields:  1 2 3 4 4
.Ve
.PP
The numbers correspond to the progressive frame the fields relate to. Here, the
first two frames are progressive, the 3rd and 4th are combed, and so on.
.PP
When \f(CW\*(C`fieldmatch\*(C'\fR is configured to run a matching from bottom
(\fBfield\fR=\fIbottom\fR) this is how this input stream get transformed:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        Input stream:

.Ve
.PP
As a result of the field matching, we can see that some frames get duplicated.
To perform a complete inverse telecine, you need to rely on a decimation filter
after this operation. See for instance the \fBdecimate\fR filter.
.PP
The same operation now matching from top fields (\fBfield\fR=\fItop\fR)
looks like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        Input stream:

In these examples, we can see what \fIp\fR, \fIc\fR and \fIn\fR mean;
basically, they refer to the frame and field of the opposite parity:

The \fIu\fR and \fIb\fR matching are a bit special in the sense that they match
from the opposite parity flag. In the following examples, we assume that we are

The output field order. Valid values are \fItff\fR for top field first or \fIbff\fR
for bottom field first.
.PP
The default value is \fBtff\fR.

The transformation is done by shifting the picture content up or down
by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture content.
This method is consistent with most broadcast field order converters.

If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
flagged as being of the required output field order, then this filter does
not alter the incoming video.

.SS fspp
.IX Subsection "fspp"
Apply fast and simple postprocessing. It is a faster version of \fBspp\fR.
.PP
It splits (I)DCT into horizontal/vertical passes. Unlike the simple post\-
processing filter, one of them is performed once per block, not per pixel.
This allows for much higher speed.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBquality\fR 4
.IX Item "quality"
Set quality. This option defines the number of levels for averaging. It accepts
an integer in the range 4\-5. Default value is \f(CW4\fR.
.IP \fBqp\fR 4

If not set, the filter will use the QP from the video stream (if available).
.IP \fBstrength\fR 4
.IX Item "strength"
Set filter strength. It accepts an integer in range \-15 to 32. Lower values mean
more details but also more artifacts, while higher values make the image smoother
but also blurrier. Default value is \f(CW0\fR − PSNR optimal.
.IP \fBuse_bframe_qp\fR 4
.IX Item "use_bframe_qp"
Enable the use of the QP from the B\-Frames if set to \f(CW1\fR. Using this

Set the blue expression.
.PP
The colorspace is selected according to the specified options. If one
of the \fBlum_expr\fR, \fBcb_expr\fR, or \fBcr_expr\fR
options is specified, the filter will automatically select a YCbCr
colorspace. If one of the \fBred_expr\fR, \fBgreen_expr\fR, or
\&\fBblue_expr\fR options is specified, it will select an RGB
colorspace.
.PP
If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on the other
one. If no alpha expression is specified it will evaluate to opaque value.
If none of chrominance expressions are specified, they will evaluate
to the luma expression.
.PP

It accepts the following parameters:
.IP \fBstrength\fR 4
.IX Item "strength"
The maximum amount by which the filter will change any one pixel. This is also
the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable values range from

.SS histeq
.IX Subsection "histeq"
This filter applies a global color histogram equalization on a
per-frame basis.
.PP
It can be used to correct video that has a compressed range of pixel
intensities.  The filter redistributes the pixel intensities to
equalize their distribution across the intensity range. It may be
viewed as an "automatically adjusting contrast filter". This filter is
useful only for correcting degraded or poorly captured source
video.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBstrength\fR 4
.IX Item "strength"
Determine the amount of equalization to be applied.  As the strength
is reduced, the distribution of pixel intensities more-and-more
approaches that of the input frame. The value must be a float number
in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.200.
.IP \fBintensity\fR 4
.IX Item "intensity"
Set the maximum intensity that can generated and scale the output
values appropriately.  The strength should be set as desired and then
the intensity can be limited if needed to avoid washing-out. The value
must be a float number in the range [0,1] and defaults to 0.210.
.IP \fBantibanding\fR 4
.IX Item "antibanding"
Set the antibanding level. If enabled the filter will randomly vary
the luminance of output pixels by a small amount to avoid banding of
the histogram. Possible values are \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`weak\*(C'\fR or

Compute and draw a color distribution histogram for the input video.
.PP
The computed histogram is a representation of the color component
distribution in an image.
.PP
Standard histogram displays the color components distribution in an image.
Displays color graph for each color component. Shows distribution of
the Y, U, V, A or R, G, B components, depending on input format, in the
current frame. Below each graph a color component scale meter is shown.

.IX Subsection "Commands"
.PP
This filter supports same \fBcommands\fR as options.
The command accepts the same syntax of the corresponding option.
.PP
If the specified expression is not valid, it is kept at its current
value.
.SS hwdownload
.IX Subsection "hwdownload"
Download hardware frames to system memory.
.PP
The input must be in hardware frames, and the output a non-hardware format.
Not all formats will be supported on the output \- it may be necessary to insert
an additional \fBformat\fR filter immediately following in the graph to get
the output in a supported format.
.SS hwmap
.IX Subsection "hwmap"
Map hardware frames to system memory or to another device.
.PP
This filter has several different modes of operation; which one is used depends
on the input and output formats:
.IP \(bu 4
Hardware frame input, normal frame output
.Sp
Map the input frames to system memory and pass them to the output.  If the
original hardware frame is later required (for example, after overlaying
something else on part of it), the \fBhwmap\fR filter can be used again
in the next mode to retrieve it.
.IP \(bu 4
Normal frame input, hardware frame output
.Sp
If the input is actually a software-mapped hardware frame, then unmap it \-
that is, return the original hardware frame.
.Sp
Otherwise, a device must be provided.  Create new hardware surfaces on that
device for the output, then map them back to the software format at the input
and give those frames to the preceding filter.  This will then act like the
\&\fBhwupload\fR filter, but may be able to avoid an additional copy when
the input is already in a compatible format.
.IP \(bu 4
Hardware frame input and output
.Sp
A device must be supplied for the output, either directly or with the
\&\fBderive_device\fR option.  The input and output devices must be of
different types and compatible \- the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).
.Sp
If the input frames were originally created on the output device, then unmap
to retrieve the original frames.
.Sp
Otherwise, map the frames to the output device \- create new hardware frames
on the output corresponding to the frames on the input.
.PP
The following additional parameters are accepted:
.IP \fBmode\fR 4
.IX Item "mode"
Set the frame mapping mode.  Some combination of:
.RS 4
.IP \fIread\fR 4
.IX Item "read"
The mapped frame should be readable.
.IP \fIwrite\fR 4
.IX Item "write"
The mapped frame should be writeable.
.IP \fIoverwrite\fR 4
.IX Item "overwrite"
The mapping will always overwrite the entire frame.
.Sp
This may improve performance in some cases, as the original contents of the
frame need not be loaded.
.IP \fIdirect\fR 4
.IX Item "direct"
The mapping must not involve any copying.
.Sp
Indirect mappings to copies of frames are created in some cases where either
direct mapping is not possible or it would have unexpected properties.
Setting this flag ensures that the mapping is direct and will fail if that is
not possible.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Defaults to \fIread+write\fR if not specified.
.RE
.IP "\fBderive_device\fR \fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "derive_device type"
Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type \fItype\fR from the device the input frames exist on.
.IP \fBreverse\fR 4
.IX Item "reverse"
In a hardware to hardware mapping, map in reverse \- create frames in the sink
and map them back to the source.  This may be necessary in some cases where
a mapping in one direction is required but only the opposite direction is
supported by the devices being used.
.Sp
This option is dangerous \- it may break the preceding filter in undefined
ways if there are any additional constraints on that filter's output.
Do not use it without fully understanding the implications of its use.
.SS hwupload
.IX Subsection "hwupload"
Upload system memory frames to hardware surfaces.
.PP
The device to upload to must be supplied when the filter is initialised.  If
using ffmpeg, select the appropriate device with the \fB\-filter_hw_device\fR
option or with the \fBderive_device\fR option.  The input and output devices
must be of different types and compatible \- the exact meaning of this is
system-dependent, but typically it means that they must refer to the same
underlying hardware context (for example, refer to the same graphics card).
.PP
The following additional parameters are accepted:
.IP "\fBderive_device\fR \fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "derive_device type"
Rather than using the device supplied at initialisation, instead derive a new
device of type \fItype\fR from the device the input frames exist on.

classification). The default of 0 means that all frames seen are given
full weight of 1.0 forever.
.IP \fBanalyze_interlaced_flag\fR 4
.IX Item "analyze_interlaced_flag"
When this is not 0 then idet will use the specified number of frames to determine
if the interlaced flag is accurate, it will not count undetermined frames.
If the flag is found to be accurate it will be used without any further
computations, if it is found to be inaccurate it will be cleared without any
further computations. This allows inserting the idet filter as a low computational
method to clean up the interlaced flag
.SS il
.IX Subsection "il"
Deinterleave or interleave fields.
.PP
This filter allows one to process interlaced images fields without
deinterlacing them. Deinterleaving splits the input frame into 2

.SS lenscorrection
.IX Subsection "lenscorrection"
Correct radial lens distortion
.PP
This filter can be used to correct for radial distortion as can result from the use
of wide angle lenses, and thereby re-rectify the image. To find the right parameters
one can use tools available for example as part of opencv or simply trial-and-error.
To use opencv use the calibration sample (under samples/cpp) from the opencv sources
and extract the k1 and k2 coefficients from the resulting matrix.
.PP
Note that effectively the same filter is available in the open-source tools Krita and
Digikam from the KDE project.
.PP
In contrast to the \fBvignette\fR filter, which can also be used to compensate lens errors,
this filter corrects the distortion of the image, whereas \fBvignette\fR corrects the
brightness distribution, so you may want to use both filters together in certain
cases, though you will have to take care of ordering, i.e. whether vignetting should
be applied before or after lens correction.
.PP
\fIOptions\fR
.IX Subsection "Options"
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBcx\fR 4

Relative x\-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
width. Default is 0.5.
.IP \fBcy\fR 4
.IX Item "cy"
Relative y\-coordinate of the focal point of the image, and thereby the center of the
distortion. This value has a range [0,1] and is expressed as fractions of the image
height. Default is 0.5.
.IP \fBk1\fR 4
.IX Item "k1"
Coefficient of the quadratic correction term. This value has a range [\-1,1]. 0 means
no correction. Default is 0.
.IP \fBk2\fR 4
.IX Item "k2"
Coefficient of the double quadratic correction term. This value has a range [\-1,1].
0 means no correction. Default is 0.
.IP \fBi\fR 4
.IX Item "i"
Set interpolation type. Can be \f(CW\*(C`nearest\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`bilinear\*(C'\fR.
Default is \f(CW\*(C`nearest\*(C'\fR.
.IP \fBfc\fR 4
.IX Item "fc"
Specify the color of the unmapped pixels. For the syntax of this option,
check the \fB"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils

.SS lensfun
.IX Subsection "lensfun"
Apply lens correction via the lensfun library (<\fBhttp://lensfun.sourceforge.net/\fR>).
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`lensfun\*(C'\fR filter requires the camera make, camera model, and lens model
to apply the lens correction. The filter will load the lensfun database and
query it to find the corresponding camera and lens entries in the database. As
long as these entries can be found with the given options, the filter can
perform corrections on frames. Note that incomplete strings will result in the
filter choosing the best match with the given options, and the filter will
output the chosen camera and lens models (logged with level "info"). You must
provide the make, camera model, and lens model as they are required.
.PP
To obtain a list of available makes and models, leave out one or both of \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`model\*(C'\fR options. The filter will send the full list to the log with level \f(CW\*(C`INFO\*(C'\fR.
The first column is the make and the second column is the model.
To obtain a list of available lenses, set any values for make and model and leave out the
\&\f(CW\*(C`lens_model\*(C'\fR option. The filter will send the full list of lenses in the log with level
\&\f(CW\*(C`INFO\*(C'\fR. The ffmpeg tool will exit after the list is printed.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBmake\fR 4
.IX Item "make"

range should be chosen when using that lens. Default 18.
.IP \fBaperture\fR 4
.IX Item "aperture"
The aperture of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
aperture is only used for vignetting correction. Default 3.5.
.IP \fBfocus_distance\fR 4
.IX Item "focus_distance"
The focus distance of the image/video (expected constant for video). Note that
focus distance is only used for vignetting and only slightly affects the
vignetting correction process. If unknown, leave it at the default value (which
is 1000).
.IP \fBscale\fR 4
.IX Item "scale"
The scale factor which is applied after transformation. After correction the
video is no longer necessarily rectangular. This parameter controls how much of
the resulting image is visible. The value 0 means that a value will be chosen
automatically such that there is little or no unmapped area in the output
image. 1.0 means that no additional scaling is done. Lower values may result
in more of the corrected image being visible, while higher values may avoid
unmapped areas in the output.

These options control the overall output mode. By default, libplacebo will try
to preserve the source colorimetry and size as best as it can, but it will
apply any embedded film grain, dolby vision metadata or anamorphic SAR present
in source frames.
.IP \fBinputs\fR 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Set the number of inputs. This can be used, alongside the \f(CW\*(C`idx\*(C'\fR variable,
to allow placing/blending multiple inputs inside the output frame. This

Set the output frame rate. This can be rational, e.g. \f(CW\*(C`60000/1001\*(C'\fR. If
set to the special string \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR (the default), input timestamps will
instead be passed through to the output unmodified. Otherwise, the input video
frames will be interpolated as necessary to rescale the video to the specified
target framerate, in a manner as determined by the \fBframe_mixer\fR option.
.IP \fBformat\fR 4
.IX Item "format"
Set the output format override. If unset (the default), frames will be output
in the same format as the respective input frames. Otherwise, format conversion
will be performed.
.IP \fBforce_original_aspect_ratio\fR 4

.IX Item "force_divisible_by"
.PD

.IP \fBnormalize_sar\fR 4
.IX Item "normalize_sar"
If enabled, output frames will always have a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1. This
will introduce additional padding/cropping as necessary. If disabled (the
default), any aspect ratio mismatches, including those from e.g. anamorphic
video sources, are forwarded to the output pixel aspect ratio.
.IP \fBpad_crop_ratio\fR 4
.IX Item "pad_crop_ratio"
Specifies a ratio (between \f(CW0.0\fR and \f(CW1.0\fR) between padding and
cropping when the input aspect ratio does not match the output aspect ratio and
\&\fBnormalize_sar\fR is in effect. The default of \f(CW0.0\fR always pads the
content with black borders, while a value of \f(CW1.0\fR always crops off parts
of the content. Intermediate values are possible, leading to a mix of the two
approaches.
.IP \fBfillcolor\fR 4
.IX Item "fillcolor"
Set the color used to fill the output area not covered by the output image, for
example as a result of \fBnormalize_sar\fR. For the general syntax of this
option, check the \fB"Color" section in the ffmpeg-utils
manual\fR. Defaults to \f(CW\*(C`black\*(C'\fR.
.IP \fBcorner_rounding\fR 4
.IX Item "corner_rounding"
Render frames with rounded corners. The value, given as a float ranging from
\&\f(CW0.0\fR to \f(CW1.0\fR, indicates the relative degree of rounding, from fully
square to fully circular. In other words, it gives the radius divided by half
the smaller side length. Defaults to \f(CW0.0\fR.

Apply Dolby Vision RPU metadata if present in source frames, and strip it from
the output. Enabled by default. Note that Dolby Vision will always output
BT.2020+PQ, overriding the usual input frame metadata. These will also be
picked as the values of \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR for the respective frame output options.

Scaling
.IX Subsection "Scaling"
.PP
The options in this section control how libplacebo performs upscaling and (if
necessary) downscaling. Note that libplacebo will always internally operate on
4:4:4 content, so any sub-sampled chroma formats such as \f(CW\*(C`yuv420p\*(C'\fR will
necessarily be upsampled and downsampled as part of the rendering process. That
means scaling might be in effect even if the source and destination resolution
are the same.

.IX Item "none"
Disables frame mixing, giving a result equivalent to "nearest neighbour"
semantics.
.IP \fBoversample\fR 4
.IX Item "oversample"
Oversamples the input video to create a "Smooth Motion"\-type effect: if an
output frame would exactly fall on the transition between two video frames, it
is blended according to the relative overlap. This is the recommended option
whenever preserving the original subjective appearance is desired.
.IP \fBmitchell_clamp\fR 4
.IX Item "mitchell_clamp"
Larger filter kernel that smoothly interpolates multiple frames in a manner
designed to eliminate ringing and other artefacts as much as possible. This is
the recommended option wherever maximum visual smoothness is desired.

.RE
.IP \fBlut_entries\fR 4
.IX Item "lut_entries"
Configures the size of scaler LUTs, ranging from \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW256\fR. The
default of \f(CW0\fR will pick libplacebo's internal default, typically
\&\f(CW64\fR.
.IP \fBantiringing\fR 4
.IX Item "antiringing"
Enables anti-ringing (for non-EWA filters). The value (between \f(CW0.0\fR and
\&\f(CW1.0\fR) configures the strength of the anti-ringing algorithm. May increase
aliasing if set too high. Disabled by default.
.IP \fBsigmoid\fR 4
.IX Item "sigmoid"
Enable sigmoidal compression during upscaling. Reduces ringing slightly.
Enabled by default.
.PP
Debanding
.IX Subsection "Debanding"
.PP
Libplacebo comes with a built-in debanding filter that is good at counteracting
many common sources of banding and blocking. Turning this on is highly
recommended whenever quality is desired.
.IP \fBdeband\fR 4
.IX Item "deband"
Enable (fast) debanding algorithm. Disabled by default.
.IP \fBdeband_iterations\fR 4
.IX Item "deband_iterations"
Number of deband iterations of the debanding algorithm. Each iteration is
performed with progressively increased radius (and diminished threshold).
Recommended values are in the range \f(CW1\fR to \f(CW4\fR. Defaults to \f(CW1\fR.
.IP \fBdeband_threshold\fR 4
.IX Item "deband_threshold"
Debanding filter strength. Higher numbers lead to more aggressive debanding.
Defaults to \f(CW4.0\fR.
.IP \fBdeband_radius\fR 4
.IX Item "deband_radius"
Debanding filter radius. A higher radius is better for slow gradients, while
a lower radius is better for steep gradients. Defaults to \f(CW16.0\fR.
.IP \fBdeband_grain\fR 4
.IX Item "deband_grain"
Amount of extra output grain to add. Helps hide imperfections. Defaults to
\&\f(CW6.0\fR.
.PP

Saturation gain, between \f(CW0.0\fR and \f(CW16.0\fR. Defaults to \f(CW1.0\fR.
.IP \fBhue\fR 4
.IX Item "hue"
Hue shift in radians, between \f(CW\-3.14\fR and \f(CW3.14\fR. Defaults to
\&\f(CW0.0\fR. This will rotate the UV subvector, defaulting to BT.709
coefficients for RGB inputs.
.IP \fBgamma\fR 4

.IP \fBcone-strength\fR 4
.IX Item "cone-strength"
Gain factor for the cones specified by \f(CW\*(C`cones\*(C'\fR, between \f(CW0.0\fR and
\&\f(CW10.0\fR. A value of \f(CW1.0\fR results in no change to color vision. A
value of \f(CW0.0\fR (the default) simulates complete loss of those cones. Values
above \f(CW1.0\fR result in exaggerating the differences between cones, which
may help compensate for reduced color vision.
.PP
Peak detection
.IX Subsection "Peak detection"
.PP
To help deal with sources that only have static HDR10 metadata (or no tagging
whatsoever), libplacebo uses its own internal frame analysis compute shader to
analyze source frames and adapt the tone mapping function in realtime. If this
is too slow, or if exactly reproducible frame-perfect results are needed, it's
recommended to turn this feature off.
.IP \fBpeak_detect\fR 4
.IX Item "peak_detect"
Enable HDR peak detection. Ignores static MaxCLL/MaxFALL values in favor of
dynamic detection from the input. Note that the detected values do not get
written back to the output frames, they merely guide the internal tone mapping
process. Enabled by default.
.IP \fBsmoothing_period\fR 4
.IX Item "smoothing_period"
Peak detection smoothing period, between \f(CW0.0\fR and \f(CW1000.0\fR. Higher
values result in peak detection becoming less responsive to changes in the
input. Defaults to \f(CW100.0\fR.
.IP \fBminimum_peak\fR 4
.IX Item "minimum_peak"
Lower bound on the detected peak (relative to SDR white), between \f(CW0.0\fR
and \f(CW100.0\fR. Defaults to \f(CW1.0\fR.
.IP \fBscene_threshold_low\fR 4
.IX Item "scene_threshold_low"
.PD 0
.IP \fBscene_threshold_high\fR 4
.IX Item "scene_threshold_high"
.PD
Lower and upper thresholds for scene change detection. Expressed in a
logarithmic scale between \f(CW0.0\fR and \f(CW100.0\fR. Default to \f(CW5.5\fR
and \f(CW10.0\fR, respectively. Setting either to a negative value disables
this functionality.
.IP \fBpercentile\fR 4
.IX Item "percentile"
Which percentile of the frame brightness histogram to use as the source peak
for tone-mapping. Defaults to \f(CW99.995\fR, a fairly conservative value.
Setting this to \f(CW100.0\fR disables frame histogram measurement and instead
uses the true peak brightness for tone-mapping.
.PP
Tone mapping
.IX Subsection "Tone mapping"
.PP
The options in this section control how libplacebo performs tone-mapping and
gamut-mapping when dealing with mismatches between wide-gamut or HDR content.
In general, libplacebo relies on accurate source tagging and mastering display
gamut information to produce the best results.
.IP \fBgamut_mode\fR 4
.IX Item "gamut_mode"
How to handle out-of-gamut colors that can occur as a result of colorimetric
gamut mapping.
.RS 4
.IP \fBclip\fR 4
.IX Item "clip"
Do nothing, simply clip out-of-range colors to the RGB volume. Low quality but
extremely fast.
.IP \fBperceptual\fR 4
.IX Item "perceptual"
Perceptually soft-clip colors to the gamut volume. This is the default.
.IP \fBrelative\fR 4
.IX Item "relative"
Relative colorimetric hard-clip. Similar to \f(CW\*(C`perceptual\*(C'\fR but without
the soft knee.
.IP \fBsaturation\fR 4
.IX Item "saturation"
Saturation mapping, maps primaries directly to primaries in RGB space.
Not recommended except for artificial computer graphics for which a bright,
saturated display is desired.
.IP \fBabsolute\fR 4
.IX Item "absolute"
Absolute colorimetric hard-clip. Performs no adjustment of the white point.
.IP \fBdesaturate\fR 4
.IX Item "desaturate"
Hard-desaturates out-of-gamut colors towards white, while preserving the
luminance. Has a tendency to distort the visual appearance of bright objects.
.IP \fBdarken\fR 4
.IX Item "darken"
Linearly reduces content brightness to preserves saturated details, followed by
clipping the remaining out-of-gamut colors.
.IP \fBwarn\fR 4
.IX Item "warn"
Highlight out-of-gamut pixels (by inverting/marking them).
.IP \fBlinear\fR 4
.IX Item "linear"
Linearly reduces chromaticity of the entire image to make it fit within the
target color volume. Be careful when using this on BT.2020 sources without
proper mastering metadata, as doing so will lead to excessive desaturation.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP \fBtonemapping\fR 4
.IX Item "tonemapping"
Tone-mapping algorithm to use. Available values are:
.RS 4
.IP \fBauto\fR 4
.IX Item "auto"
Automatic selection based on internal heuristics. This is the default.
.IP \fBclip\fR 4
.IX Item "clip"
Performs no tone-mapping, just clips out-of-range colors. Retains perfect color
accuracy for in-range colors but completely destroys out-of-range information.
Does not perform any black point adaptation. Not configurable.
.IP \fBst2094\-40\fR 4
.IX Item "st2094-40"
EETF from SMPTE ST 2094\-40 Annex B, which applies the Bezier curves from HDR10+
dynamic metadata based on Bezier curves to perform tone-mapping. The OOTF used
is adjusted based on the ratio between the targeted and actual display peak
luminances.
.IP \fBst2094\-10\fR 4
.IX Item "st2094-10"
EETF from SMPTE ST 2094\-10 Annex B.2, which takes into account the input signal
average luminance in addition to the maximum/minimum. The configurable contrast
parameter influences the slope of the linear output segment, defaulting to
\&\f(CW1.0\fR for no increase/decrease in contrast. Note that this does not
currently include the subjective gain/offset/gamma controls defined in Annex
B.3.
.IP \fBbt.2390\fR 4
.IX Item "bt.2390"
EETF from the ITU-R Report BT.2390, a hermite spline roll-off with linear
segment. The knee point offset is configurable. Note that this parameter
defaults to \f(CW1.0\fR, rather than the value of \f(CW0.5\fR from the ITU-R
spec.
.IP \fBbt.2446a\fR 4
.IX Item "bt.2446a"
EETF from ITU-R Report BT.2446, method A. Designed for well-mastered HDR
sources. Can be used for both forward and inverse tone mapping. Not
configurable.
.IP \fBspline\fR 4
.IX Item "spline"
Simple spline consisting of two polynomials, joined by a single pivot point.
The parameter gives the pivot point (in PQ space), defaulting to \f(CW0.30\fR.
Can be used for both forward and inverse tone mapping.
.IP \fBreinhard\fR 4
.IX Item "reinhard"
Simple non-linear, global tone mapping algorithm. The parameter specifies the
local contrast coefficient at the display peak. Essentially, a parameter of
\&\f(CW0.5\fR implies that the reference white will be about half as bright as
when clipping. Defaults to \f(CW0.5\fR, which results in the simplest
formulation of this function.
.IP \fBmobius\fR 4
.IX Item "mobius"
Generalization of the reinhard tone mapping algorithm to support an additional
linear slope near black. The tone mapping parameter indicates the trade-off
between the linear section and the non-linear section. Essentially, for a given
parameter \fIx\fR, every color value below \fIx\fR will be mapped linearly,
while higher values get non-linearly tone-mapped. Values near \f(CW1.0\fR make
this curve behave like \f(CW\*(C`clip\*(C'\fR, while values near \f(CW0.0\fR make this
curve behave like \f(CW\*(C`reinhard\*(C'\fR. The default value is \f(CW0.3\fR, which
provides a good balance between colorimetric accuracy and preserving
out-of-gamut details.
.IP \fBhable\fR 4
.IX Item "hable"
Piece-wise, filmic tone-mapping algorithm developed by John Hable for use in
Uncharted 2, inspired by a similar tone-mapping algorithm used by Kodak.
Popularized by its use in video games with HDR rendering. Preserves both dark
and bright details very well, but comes with the drawback of changing the
average brightness quite significantly. This is sort of similar to
\&\f(CW\*(C`reinhard\*(C'\fR with parameter \f(CW0.24\fR.
.IP \fBgamma\fR 4
.IX Item "gamma"
Fits a gamma (power) function to transfer between the source and target color
spaces, effectively resulting in a perceptual hard-knee joining two roughly
linear sections. This preserves details at all scales fairly accurately, but
can result in an image with a muted or dull appearance. The parameter is used
as the cutoff point, defaulting to \f(CW0.5\fR.
.IP \fBlinear\fR 4
.IX Item "linear"
Linearly stretches the input range to the output range, in PQ space. This will
preserve all details accurately, but results in a significantly different
average brightness. Can be used for inverse tone-mapping in addition to regular
tone-mapping. The parameter can be used as an additional linear gain
coefficient (defaulting to \f(CW1.0\fR).
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP \fBtonemapping_param\fR 4
.IX Item "tonemapping_param"
For tunable tone mapping functions, this parameter can be used to fine-tune the
curve behavior. Refer to the documentation of \f(CW\*(C`tonemapping\*(C'\fR. The default
value of \f(CW0.0\fR is replaced by the curve's preferred default setting.
.IP \fBinverse_tonemapping\fR 4
.IX Item "inverse_tonemapping"
If enabled, this filter will also attempt stretching SDR signals to fill HDR
output color volumes. Disabled by default.
.IP \fBtonemapping_lut_size\fR 4
.IX Item "tonemapping_lut_size"
Size of the tone-mapping LUT, between \f(CW2\fR and \f(CW1024\fR. Defaults to
\&\f(CW256\fR. Note that this figure is squared when combined with
\&\f(CW\*(C`peak_detect\*(C'\fR.
.IP \fBcontrast_recovery\fR 4
.IX Item "contrast_recovery"
Contrast recovery strength. If set to a value above \f(CW0.0\fR, the source
image will be divided into high-frequency and low-frequency components, and a
portion of the high-frequency image is added back onto the tone-mapped output.
May cause excessive ringing artifacts for some HDR sources, but can improve the
subjective sharpness and detail left over in the image after tone-mapping.
Defaults to \f(CW0.30\fR.
.IP \fBcontrast_smoothness\fR 4
.IX Item "contrast_smoothness"
Contrast recovery lowpass kernel size. Defaults to \f(CW3.5\fR. Increasing or
decreasing this will affect the visual appearance substantially. Has no effect
when \f(CW\*(C`contrast_recovery\*(C'\fR is disabled.
.PP
Dithering
.IX Subsection "Dithering"
.PP
By default, libplacebo will dither whenever necessary, which includes rendering
to any integer format below 16\-bit precision. It's recommended to always leave
this on, since not doing so may result in visible banding in the output, even
if the \f(CW\*(C`debanding\*(C'\fR filter is enabled. If maximum performance is needed,
use \f(CW\*(C`ordered_fixed\*(C'\fR instead of disabling dithering.
.IP \fBdithering\fR 4
.IX Item "dithering"
Dithering method to use. Accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP \fBnone\fR 4
.IX Item "none"

.RE
.IP \fBdither_lut_size\fR 4

.IP \fBdither_temporal\fR 4
.IX Item "dither_temporal"
Enables temporal dithering. Disabled by default.

The prescreener is trained to know whether cubic interpolation will be
sufficient for a pixel or whether it should be predicted by the predictor nn.
The computational complexity of the prescreener nn is much less than that of
the predictor nn. Since most pixels can be handled by cubic interpolation,
using the prescreener generally results in much faster processing.
The prescreener is pretty accurate, so the difference between using it and not
using it is almost always unnoticeable.

.SS normalize
.IX Subsection "normalize"
Normalize RGB video (aka histogram stretching, contrast stretching).
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(image_processing)
.PP
For each channel of each frame, the filter computes the input range and maps
it linearly to the user-specified output range. The output range defaults
to the full dynamic range from pure black to pure white.
.PP
Temporal smoothing can be used on the input range to reduce flickering (rapid
changes in brightness) caused when small dark or bright objects enter or leave
the scene. This is similar to the auto-exposure (automatic gain control) on a
video camera, and, like a video camera, it may cause a period of over\- or
under-exposure of the video.
.PP
The R,G,B channels can be normalized independently, which may cause some
color shifting, or linked together as a single channel, which prevents
color shifting. Linked normalization preserves hue. Independent normalization
does not, so it can be used to remove some color casts. Independent and linked
normalization can be combined in any ratio.
.PP
The normalize filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBblackpt\fR 4

the \fIblackpt\fR. The maximum input value is mapped to the \fIwhitept\fR.
The defaults are black and white respectively. Specifying white for
\&\fIblackpt\fR and black for \fIwhitept\fR will give color-inverted,
normalized video. Shades of grey can be used to reduce the dynamic range
(contrast). Specifying saturated colors here can create some interesting
effects.
.IP \fBsmoothing\fR 4

.SS ocv
.IX Subsection "ocv"
Apply a video transform using libopencv.
.PP
To enable this filter, install the libopencv library and headers and
configure FFmpeg with \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libopencv\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP \fBfilter_name\fR 4
.IX Item "filter_name"
The name of the libopencv filter to apply.
.IP \fBfilter_params\fR 4
.IX Item "filter_params"
The parameters to pass to the libopencv filter. If not specified, the default
values are assumed.
.PP
Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
information:
<\fBhttp://docs.opencv.org/master/modules/imgproc/doc/filtering.html\fR>
.PP
Several libopencv filters are supported; see the following subsections.
.PP
\fIdilate\fR
.IX Subsection "dilate"
.PP
Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.
It corresponds to the libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvDilate\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the parameters: \fIstruct_el\fR|\fInb_iterations\fR.
.PP
\&\fIstruct_el\fR represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
\&\fIcols\fRx\fIrows\fR+\fIanchor_x\fRx\fIanchor_y\fR/\fIshape\fR
.PP
\&\fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR represent the number of columns and rows of
the structuring element, \fIanchor_x\fR and \fIanchor_y\fR the anchor
point, and \fIshape\fR the shape for the structuring element. \fIshape\fR
must be "rect", "cross", "ellipse", or "custom".
.PP
If the value for \fIshape\fR is "custom", it must be followed by a
string of the form "=\fIfilename\fR". The file with name
\&\fIfilename\fR is assumed to represent a binary image, with each
printable character corresponding to a bright pixel. When a custom
\&\fIshape\fR is used, \fIcols\fR and \fIrows\fR are ignored, the number
or columns and rows of the read file are assumed instead.
.PP
The default value for \fIstruct_el\fR is "3x3+0x0/rect".
.PP
\&\fInb_iterations\fR specifies the number of times the transform is
applied to the image, and defaults to 1.
.PP
Some examples:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # Use the default values
\&        ocv=dilate

.Ve
.PP
\fIerode\fR
.IX Subsection "erode"
.PP

It corresponds to the libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvErode\*(C'\fR.
.PP
It accepts the parameters: \fIstruct_el\fR:\fInb_iterations\fR,
with the same syntax and semantics as the \fBdilate\fR filter.
.PP
\fIsmooth\fR
.IX Subsection "smooth"
.PP
Smooth the input video.
.PP
The filter takes the following parameters:
\&\fItype\fR|\fIparam1\fR|\fIparam2\fR|\fIparam3\fR|\fIparam4\fR.
.PP
\&\fItype\fR is the type of smooth filter to apply, and must be one of
the following values: "blur", "blur_no_scale", "median", "gaussian",
or "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".
.PP
The meaning of \fIparam1\fR, \fIparam2\fR, \fIparam3\fR, and \fIparam4\fR
depends on the smooth type. \fIparam1\fR and
\&\fIparam2\fR accept integer positive values or 0. \fIparam3\fR and
\&\fIparam4\fR accept floating point values.
.PP
The default value for \fIparam1\fR is 3. The default value for the
other parameters is 0.
.PP
These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the
libopencv function \f(CW\*(C`cvSmooth\*(C'\fR.

Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a good idea
to pass the two inputs through a \fIsetpts=PTS\-STARTPTS\fR filter to

.SS psnr
.IX Subsection "psnr"
Obtain the average, maximum and minimum PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise
Ratio) between two input videos.
.PP
This filter takes in input two input videos, the first input is
considered the "main" source and is passed unchanged to the
output. The second input is used as a "reference" video for computing
the PSNR.
.PP
Both video inputs must have the same resolution and pixel format for
this filter to work correctly. Also it assumes that both inputs
have the same number of frames, which are compared one by one.
.PP
The obtained average PSNR is printed through the logging system.
.PP
The filter stores the accumulated MSE (mean squared error) of each
frame, and at the end of the processing it is averaged across all frames
equally, and the following formula is applied to obtain the PSNR:
.PP
.Vb 1

.SS pullup
.IX Subsection "pullup"
Pulldown reversal (inverse telecine) filter, capable of handling mixed
hard-telecine, 24000/1001 fps progressive, and 30000/1001 fps progressive
content.
.PP
The pullup filter is designed to take advantage of future context in making
its decisions. This filter is stateless in the sense that it does not lock
onto a pattern to follow, but it instead looks forward to the following
fields in order to identify matches and rebuild progressive frames.
.PP
To produce content with an even framerate, insert the fps filter after
pullup, use \f(CW\*(C`fps=24000/1001\*(C'\fR if the input frame rate is 29.97fps,
\&\f(CW\*(C`fps=24\*(C'\fR for 30fps and the (rare) telecined 25fps input.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBjl\fR 4
.IX Item "jl"
.PD 0
.IP \fBjr\fR 4
.IX Item "jr"
.IP \fBjt\fR 4
.IX Item "jt"
.IP \fBjb\fR 4
.IX Item "jb"
.PD
These options set the amount of "junk" to ignore at the left, right, top, and
bottom of the image, respectively. Left and right are in units of 8 pixels,
while top and bottom are in units of 2 lines.
The default is 8 pixels on each side.
.IP \fBsb\fR 4
.IX Item "sb"
Set the strict breaks. Setting this option to 1 will reduce the chances of
filter generating an occasional mismatched frame, but it may also cause an
excessive number of frames to be dropped during high motion sequences.
Conversely, setting it to \-1 will make filter match fields more easily.
This may help processing of video where there is slight blurring between
the fields, but may also cause there to be interlaced frames in the output.
Default value is \f(CW0\fR.
.IP \fBmp\fR 4
.IX Item "mp"
Set the metric plane to use. It accepts the following values:
.RS 4
.IP \fBl\fR 4
.IX Item "l"
Use luma plane.
.IP \fBu\fR 4
.IX Item "u"
Use chroma blue plane.
.IP \fBv\fR 4
.IX Item "v"
Use chroma red plane.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This option may be set to use chroma plane instead of the default luma plane
for doing filter's computations. This may improve accuracy on very clean
source material, but more likely will decrease accuracy, especially if there
is chroma noise (rainbow effect) or any grayscale video.
The main purpose of setting \fBmp\fR to a chroma plane is to reduce CPU
load and make pullup usable in realtime on slow machines.
.RE
.PP
For best results (without duplicated frames in the output file) it is
necessary to change the output frame rate. For example, to inverse

Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which

comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the filter bitmap file, which can be any image format supported by
libavformat. The width and height of the image file must match those of the
video stream being processed.
.PP
Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of
the logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the
rest, you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is
recommended to take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo
visible, and then using a threshold filter followed by the erode
filter once or twice.
.PP
If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much
reduced. Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as
much, but it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over
the image and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra
pixels will slow things down on a large logo.

Specify the transition point from linear to mobius transform. Every value
below this point is guaranteed to be mapped 1:1. The higher the value, the
more accurate the result will be, at the cost of losing bright details.
Default to 0.3, which due to the steep initial slope still preserves in-range
colors fairly accurately.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP \fBdesat\fR 4
.IX Item "desat"
Apply desaturation for highlights that exceed this level of brightness. The
higher the parameter, the more color information will be preserved. This
setting helps prevent unnaturally blown-out colors for super-highlights, by
(smoothly) turning into white instead. This makes images feel more natural,
at the cost of reducing information about out-of-range colors.
.Sp
The default of 2.0 is somewhat conservative and will mostly just apply to
skies or directly sunlit surfaces. A setting of 0.0 disables this option.
.Sp
This option works only if the input frame has a supported color tag.

.SS trim
.IX Subsection "trim"
Trim the input so that the output contains one continuous subpart of the input.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP \fBstart\fR 4
.IX Item "start"
Specify the time of the start of the kept section, i.e. the frame with the
timestamp \fIstart\fR will be the first frame in the output.
.IP \fBend\fR 4
.IX Item "end"
Specify the time of the first frame that will be dropped, i.e. the frame
immediately preceding the one with the timestamp \fIend\fR will be the last
frame in the output.
.IP \fBstart_pts\fR 4

in timebase units instead of seconds.
.IP \fBend_pts\fR 4

.PP
\&\fBstart\fR, \fBend\fR, and \fBduration\fR are expressed as time
duration specifications; see
\&\fBthe Time duration section in the ffmpeg\-utils\|(1) manual\fR
for the accepted syntax.
.PP
Note that the first two sets of the start/end options and the \fBduration\fR
option look at the frame timestamp, while the _frame variants simply count the
frames that pass through the filter. Also note that this filter does not modify
the timestamps. If you wish for the output timestamps to start at zero, insert a
setpts filter after the trim filter.
.PP
If multiple start or end options are set, this filter tries to be greedy and
keep all the frames that match at least one of the specified constraints. To keep
only the part that matches all the constraints at once, chain multiple trim
filters.
.PP
The defaults are such that all the input is kept. So it is possible to set e.g.
just the end values to keep everything before the specified time.
.PP
Examples:
.IP \(bu 4

.PP
The waveform monitor plots color component intensity. By default luma
only. Each column of the waveform corresponds to a column of pixels in the
source video.
.PP
It accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBmode, m\fR" 4
.IX Item "mode, m"
Can be either \f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR. Default is \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR.
In row mode, the graph on the left side represents color component value 0 and
the right side represents value = 255. In column mode, the top side represents
color component value = 0 and bottom side represents value = 255.
.IP "\fBintensity, i\fR" 4
.IX Item "intensity, i"
Set intensity. Smaller values are useful to find out how many values of the same
luminance are distributed across input rows/columns.
Default value is \f(CW0.04\fR. Allowed range is [0, 1].
.IP "\fBmirror, r\fR" 4
.IX Item "mirror, r"

.IP \fBoverlay\fR 4
.IX Item "overlay"
Presents information identical to that in the \f(CW\*(C`parade\*(C'\fR, except
that the graphs representing color components are superimposed directly
over one another.

This display mode makes it easier to spot relative differences or similarities
in overlapping areas of the color components that are supposed to be identical,
such as neutral whites, grays, or blacks.
.IP \fBstack\fR 4
.IX Item "stack"
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
\&\f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR mode or one below the other in \f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR mode.

.IX Item "parade"
Display separate graph for the color components side by side in
\&\f(CW\*(C`column\*(C'\fR mode or one below the other in \f(CW\*(C`row\*(C'\fR mode.
.Sp
Using this display mode makes it easy to spot color casts in the highlights
and shadows of an image, by comparing the contours of the top and the bottom
graphs of each waveform. Since whites, grays, and blacks are characterized
by exactly equal amounts of red, green, and blue, neutral areas of the picture
should display three waveforms of roughly equal width/height. If not, the
correction is easy to perform by making level adjustments the three waveforms.

All streams must be of same pixel format.
.PP
The filter accepts the following options:
.IP \fBinputs\fR 4
.IX Item "inputs"
Set number of input streams. Default is 2.
.IP \fBlayout\fR 4
.IX Item "layout"
Specify layout of inputs.
This option requires the desired layout configuration to be explicitly set by the user.
This sets position of each video input in output. Each input
is separated by '|'.
The first number represents the column, and the second number represents the row.
Numbers start at 0 and are separated by '_'. Optionally one can use wX and hX,
where X is video input from which to take width or height.
Multiple values can be used when separated by '+'. In such
case values are summed together.
.Sp
Note that if inputs are of different sizes gaps may appear, as not all of
the output video frame will be filled. Similarly, videos can overlap each
other if their position doesn't leave enough space for the full frame of
adjoining videos.
.Sp
For 2 inputs, a default layout of \f(CW\*(C`0_0|w0_0\*(C'\fR (equivalent to
\&\f(CW\*(C`grid=2x1\*(C'\fR) is set. In all other cases, a layout or a grid must be set by
the user. Either \f(CW\*(C`grid\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`layout\*(C'\fR can be specified at a time.
Specifying both will result in an error.
.IP \fBgrid\fR 4
.IX Item "grid"
Specify a fixed size grid of inputs.
This option is used to create a fixed size grid of the input streams. Set the
grid size in the form \f(CW\*(C`COLUMNSxROWS\*(C'\fR. There must be \f(CW\*(C`ROWS * COLUMNS\*(C'\fR
input streams and they will be arranged as a grid with \f(CW\*(C`ROWS\*(C'\fR rows and
\&\f(CW\*(C`COLUMNS\*(C'\fR columns. When using this option, each input stream within a row
must have the same height and all the rows must have the same width.
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`grid\*(C'\fR is set, then \f(CW\*(C`inputs\*(C'\fR option is ignored and is implicitly
set to \f(CW\*(C`ROWS * COLUMNS\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
For 2 inputs, a default grid of \f(CW\*(C`2x1\*(C'\fR (equivalent to

To enable compilation of these filters you need to configure FFmpeg with

Running OpenCL filters requires you to initialize a hardware device and to pass that device to all filters in any filter graph.

Since OpenCL filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded(\fBhwupload\fR) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded(\fBhwdownload\fR) back to normal memory. Note that \fBhwupload\fR will upload to a surface with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a \fBformat\fR filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and \fBhwdownload\fR does not support all formats on the output \- it may be necessary to insert an additional \fBformat\fR filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.

As Vulkan filters are not able to access frame data in normal memory, all frame data needs to be uploaded (\fBhwupload\fR) to hardware surfaces connected to the appropriate device before being used and then downloaded (\fBhwdownload\fR) back to normal memory. Note that \fBhwupload\fR will upload to a frame with the same layout as the software frame, so it may be necessary to add a \fBformat\fR filter immediately before to get the input into the right format and \fBhwdownload\fR does not support all formats on the output \- it is usually necessary to insert an additional \fBformat\fR filter immediately following in the graph to get the output in a supported format.

.SH "VIDEO SOURCES"
.IX Header "VIDEO SOURCES"
Below is a description of the currently available video sources.
.SS buffer
.IX Subsection "buffer"
Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.
.PP
This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
through the interface defined in \fIlibavfilter/buffersrc.h\fR.
.PP
It accepts the following parameters:
.IP \fBvideo_size\fR 4
.IX Item "video_size"
Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames. For the
syntax of this option, check the
\&\fB"Video size" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual\fR.
.IP \fBwidth\fR 4
.IX Item "width"
The input video width.
.IP \fBheight\fR 4
.IX Item "height"
The input video height.
.IP \fBpix_fmt\fR 4
.IX Item "pix_fmt"
A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video frames.
It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a pixel format
name.
.IP \fBtime_base\fR 4
.IX Item "time_base"
Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered frames.
.IP \fBframe_rate\fR 4
.IX Item "frame_rate"
Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.
.IP "\fBpixel_aspect, sar\fR" 4
.IX Item "pixel_aspect, sar"
The sample (pixel) aspect ratio of the input video.
.IP \fBhw_frames_ctx\fR 4
.IX Item "hw_frames_ctx"
When using a hardware pixel format, this should be a reference to an
AVHWFramesContext describing input frames.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        buffer=width=320:height=240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:sar=1
.Ve
.PP
will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).
Since the pixel format with name "yuv410p" corresponds to the number 6
(check the enum AVPixelFormat definition in \fIlibavutil/pixfmt.h\fR),
this example corresponds to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1
.Ve
.PP
Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this

.SS life
.IX Subsection "life"
Generate a life pattern.
.PP
This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.
.PP
The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.
.PP
At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
cell stay alive or born. The \fBrule\fR option allows one to specify
the rule to adopt.
.PP
This source accepts the following options:
.IP "\fBfilename, f\fR" 4
.IX Item "filename, f"
Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the file,
each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell, and newline
is used to delimit the end of each row.
.Sp
If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
randomly.
.IP "\fBrate, r\fR" 4
.IX Item "rate, r"
Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per second.
Default is 25.
.IP "\fBrandom_fill_ratio, ratio\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_fill_ratio, ratio"
Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.

.IP "\fBrandom_seed, seed\fR" 4
.IX Item "random_seed, seed"
Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an integer
included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if explicitly
set to \-1, the filter will try to use a good random seed on a best
effort basis.
.IP \fBrule\fR 4
.IX Item "rule"
Set the life rule.
.Sp
A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "S\fINS\fR/B\fINB\fR",
where \fINS\fR and \fINB\fR are sequences of numbers in the range 0\-8,
\&\fINS\fR specifies the number of alive neighbor cells which make a
live cell stay alive, and \fINB\fR the number of alive neighbor cells
which make a dead cell to become alive (i.e. to "born").
"s" and "b" can be used in place of "S" and "B", respectively.
.Sp
Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18\-bits integer. The 9
high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is alive
for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits specify
the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode for an
higher number of neighbor cells.
For example the number 6153 = \f(CW\*(C`(12<<9)+9\*(C'\fR specifies a stay alive
rule of 12 and a born rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".
.Sp
Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway's game of life
rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor alive
cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive cells around
a dead cell.

.PP
There are \fIn\fRx(\fIv\fR+\fIa\fR) inputs: first the inputs for the first
segment, in the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second
segment, etc.
.PP
Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for various
reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For that reason,
related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio track) should be
concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the duration of the longest
stream in each segment (except the last one), and if necessary pad shorter
audio streams with silence.
.PP
For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp 0.
.PP
All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all segments; the
filtering system will automatically select a common pixel format for video
streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and channel layout for
audio streams, but other settings, such as resolution, must be converted
explicitly by the user.

Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame rate
at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.

the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds), but can optionally be configured

Temporally interleave frames from several inputs.

\&\f(CW\*(C`interleave\*(C'\fR works with video inputs, \f(CW\*(C`ainterleave\*(C'\fR with audio.
.PP
These filters read frames from several inputs and send the oldest
queued frame to the output.
.PP
Input streams must have well defined, monotonically increasing frame
timestamp values.
.PP
In order to submit one frame to output, these filters need to enqueue
at least one frame for each input, so they cannot work in case one
input is not yet terminated and will not receive incoming frames.
.PP
For example consider the case when one input is a \f(CW\*(C`select\*(C'\fR filter
which always drops input frames. The \f(CW\*(C`interleave\*(C'\fR filter will keep
reading from that input, but it will never be able to send new frames
to output until the input sends an end-of-stream signal.

frames in case one input receives more frames than the other ones, and

.IP "\fBscene\fR \fI(video only)\fR" 4
.IX Item "scene (video only)"
value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects a low
probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene, while a higher
value means the current frame is more likely to be one (see the example below)
.IP \fBconcatdec_select\fR 4
.IX Item "concatdec_select"
The concat demuxer can select only part of a concat input file by setting an
inpoint and an outpoint, but the output packets may not be entirely contained
in the selected interval. By using this variable, it is possible to skip frames
generated by the concat demuxer which are not exactly contained in the selected
interval.
.Sp
This works by comparing the frame pts against the \fIlavf.concat.start_time\fR
and the \fIlavf.concat.duration\fR packet metadata values which are also
present in the decoded frames.
.Sp
The \fIconcatdec_select\fR variable is \-1 if the frame pts is at least
start_time and either the duration metadata is missing or the frame pts is less
than start_time + duration, 0 otherwise, and NaN if the start_time metadata is
missing.
.Sp
That basically means that an input frame is selected if its pts is within the
interval set by the concat demuxer.

The default value of the select expression is "1".

A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
interval.
.PP
An interval is specified by the following syntax:
.PP
.Vb 1

.Ve
.PP
The time interval is specified by the \fISTART\fR and \fIEND\fR times.
\&\fIEND\fR is optional and defaults to the maximum time.
.PP
The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
it is included in the interval [\fISTART\fR, \fIEND\fR), that is when
the time is greater or equal to \fISTART\fR and is lesser than
\&\fIEND\fR.
.PP

be a non-null sequence of identifier flags separated by "+" or "|" and
enclosed between "[" and "]".
.PP
The following flags are recognized:

Synthesize audio from 2 input video spectrums, first input stream represents

This filter is primarily created for reversing processed \fBshowspectrum\fR

But in such case results are going to be poor if the phase data is not
available, because in such cases phase data need to be recreated, usually
it's just recreated from random noise.
For best results use gray only output (\f(CW\*(C`channel\*(C'\fR color mode in
\&\fBshowspectrum\fR filter) and \f(CW\*(C`log\*(C'\fR scale for magnitude video and
\&\f(CW\*(C`lin\*(C'\fR scale for phase video. To produce phase, for 2nd video, use

.SS codec2
.IX Subsection "codec2"
FFmpeg can make use of the codec2 library for codec2 decoding and encoding.
There is currently no native decoder, so libcodec2 must be used for decoding.
.PP
Go to <\fBhttp://freedv.org/\fR>, download "Codec 2 source archive".
Build and install using CMake. Debian users can install the libcodec2\-dev package instead.
Once libcodec2 is installed you can pass \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-libcodec2\*(C'\fR to configure to enable it.
.PP
The easiest way to use codec2 is with .c2 files, since they contain the mode information required for decoding.
To encode such a file, use a .c2 file extension and give the libcodec2 encoder the \-mode option:
\&\f(CW\*(C`ffmpeg \-i input.wav \-mode 700C output.c2\*(C'\fR.
Playback is as simple as \f(CW\*(C`ffplay output.c2\*(C'\fR.
For a list of supported modes, run \f(CW\*(C`ffmpeg \-h encoder=libcodec2\*(C'\fR.
Raw codec2 files are also supported.
